The real advancement instead was our acceptance of them. The first guy who ever carried one in England, Jonas Hanway, may have kept himself dry in a storm, but he surely had his gawkers on the street. According to The Magazine of American History, umbrellas in Hanway's time were ""long regarded as a sign of extreme effeminacy, and they multiplied very slowly."" ""For many years those who used umbrellas in the streets were exposed to the insults of the mob,"" the article explains, ""and to the persistent and very natural animosity of the hackney coachman, who bespattered them with mud and lashed them furiously with their whips.""  Thank goodness we've evolved. Today, umbrellas aren't just protection from the elements but a mark of style, and an investment in the right one will ensure you have an umbrella that lasts. The following umbrellas are backed by a limited lifetime guarantee (which usually means the lifetime of the product, not YOUR actual lifetime). Normal wear and tear? Generally not covered. But if you're ever displeased with any of these umbrellas here, there's a good chance the brand will do whatever it can to make it up to you. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

More importantly, though, women have boobs and butts. At first glance, you might gather that's the message behind a growing Instagram account, ""Babes For Trump"" which proclaims to be, ""Making America Great Again One Babe At A Time.""  The account, that is run by men, houses dozens of images of conventionally-attractive women baring it all in the name of supporting Trump. The photos range from women covering their nipples with Trump stickers, to others where support for Trump is expressed through campaign slogans Sharpied onto women's butts. There are also a number of photos posted on the account that make no reference to Trump at all, but viewers can glean the subjects' political preferences based on the accompanying hashtags: #babe4trump #babes4trump #babefortrump #babesfortrump #trump #trump2016 #trumpgirls #donaldtrump #bootypics #bootybootybooty. The below images may be considered NSFW.        Tat my name on you so I know it's real ✊ that left cheek busy making America great again #babesfortrump Tag a Friend & Double Tap #babes4trump #babes4trump #beachbums #beachbabe #tatmynameonyousoiknowitsreal #trumprumps #trumpbooty #makeamericagreatagain #makingamericagreatagain #maga #trump #trump2016 #trumptrain #votetrump #comeandtakeit #springbreak2016 #springbreak #tfmgirls #tfm #college #collegebabes #collegebooty #bootypics #bootyfordays #bootys4trump #bootybootybooty A photo posted by Babes For Trump (@babesfortrump) on Mar 24, 2016 at 8:35am PDT   The four college men behind Babes For Trump, which is also on Snapchat and Twitter, wouldn't disclose their names, but told The Huffington Post their goal was to ""create a unique platform for college students, primarily women, to express their political views."" When asked how posting pictures of almost-naked women helps to elevate female voices, the guys said that simply drawing attention to their account, which has over 3,000 followers and only posts photos that were submitted to them, does just that. ""Just recently a woman from California reached out thanking us for giving girls the chance to be heard and praised for their thoughts without being attacked,"" the creators told HuffPost. And they don't deny that sex sells: ""These pictures represent women in a manner to which they can be desired.""

To the contrary, a woman's right to exercise bodily autonomy, however she chooses to do that, is exactly why it's so important for women to be involved in the political process. But the Babes For Trump account is uncomfortably reminiscent of their favorite presidential candidate's sexist proclivity for ranking women based on their appearances.  Donald Trump has a long and storied history of equating a woman's value with her looks. Most recently, the GOP frontrunner retweeted an image of his wife Melania juxtaposed with an unflattering shot of Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi -- presumably to prove that Melania is hotter. One post on Babes For Trump seems to echo that meme, showing a split-screen image of a female Bernie Sanders supporter and the butts of two Trump supporters. The caption charmingly reads, ""You decide. We know who we're going with.""  Troubled by the notion that a candidate's worth might be determined by the perceived hotness of his or her voters, we suggested to the creators that, maybe we shouldn't be voting based on whose supporters have nicer asses. The Babes For Trump masterminds agreed -- though they didn't feel that their account was pushing any such idea. ""People shouldn't make a decision based off an ass, that's ridiculous,"" they said. ""The people who follow our account are more likely to be attracted to a woman like the one associated with Trump in our picture, compared to that of the Bernie supporter. It's also evident that some people may find the opposite to be true, where the Bernie supporter may be found more desirable.""  Though the captions posted under the Babes For Trump photos don't explain why the women in said photos are voting for Trump, the male creators believe that the candidate's female supporters are able to reconcile his questionable views about women because he has other things to offer. ""We think people have the capability to move past those sort of things and look at the bigger picture,"" they told HuffPost. ""People align with his policies and philosophies more than his comments and look past them."" If you are a woman who is voting for Trump, we'd love to hear from you. Email women@huffingtonpost.com.       Oh wow...

2,Natalia Brzezinski,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/natalia-lopatniuk-brzezinski/a-brilliant-mind-founding_b_9556662.html,A Brilliant Mind: Founding Tech Companies with Heart,"There's wide global awareness today that we need an entrepreneurial approach to solving the challenges of today and unearthing the opportunities of tomorrow. Women are a key element of diversity and discovery in the algorithm of future innovation.   As ""talking heads"" tout the need for more women in leadership roles and especially as founders and tech entrepreneurs, I often wonder how authentic this call for action really is?   As someone that presently works in both the U.S. and Sweden, increasingly I feel that in America women are still ""nice to have"" while in Sweden women are a ""must have."" Gender diversity in the Nordics is core to the business model and seen as a source of startup creativity.   In Sweden, entrepreneurs start companies because they can. The country provides a social safety net and comfort level for young people to be able to take a leap without the cost of a fall breaking their necks, credit and bank accounts.   Stockholm was ranked number three in Europe for best startups and second place for ability to scale startups internationally, according to the European Digital City Index for 2015.   In 2015, for the first time ever half of the investment capital awarded to startups form prestigious incubator ""Sting"" went to those female-led and female-founded companies, according to The Local Sweden.   There was no quota or mandate behind this; the seed capital simply went to the best ideas. Women see the world differently, often following more empathetic and values-driven concepts, and different is good in the world of innovation.   Just ask Lisa Lindstrom, CEO and founder of dobermandesign.com, and one of Sweden's earliest and most successful female tech founders.     ""I do see myself as different in why I chose to be a founder. For me founding a company was a necessity to nurture my curiosity, never a thought-out plan. I wanted to explore if it was possible to run a company combining an extreme commitment to quality with well-being and empathy. And the only platform to explore this was to found one myself, together with some friends. That's it.""  I met Lisa several years ago when I first moved to Stockholm, and she changed the way I viewed leadership and innovation enormously from one based in sheer ""American dream-driven"" competition, to one steeped in inclusion, transparency and openness. She taught me that women can be both leaders and listeners, mothers and change-makers, CEOs and chief-communicators never afraid to take a stand and voice their own accomplishments and that of other women.   ""I also remember our first meeting where we discussed how the Swedish work culture could be exported to the U.S., and the American confidence to stand out exported to Sweden. One way that Swedish culture empowers both male and female entrepreneurs is through paid parental leave. Swedish work culture makes it possible for both men and women to work, found companies and have a family.""  Lindstrom and her co-founder, Anders Frostenson, who is based in New York City, have worked to coalesce a grassroots movement of New York's most creative leaders and agencies to advance parental leave called the Pledge Parental Leave.   ""The PPL makes me really hopeful that we could change the world. In small steps.""  Her disruptive leadership style and courage to use her voice to break down barriers are precisely why she is part of our multiplier community for Brilliant Minds thought leadership gathering, part of Stockholm Symposium.  Brilliant Minds is a thought leadership summit, which aims to find the next global disruptors before they hit the Ted stage and combine them with some of the world's most established entrepreneurs and leaders. This two-day conference is part of Stockholm Symposium week, a platform and bridge for the world's most creative and socially conscious minds to come together to redefine collaborative creativity and find ways to challenge the status quo for good.   Natalia Brzezinski: There are so few female tech founders, even in Sweden, where women ""have it all"" in terms of social and government support to work (maternity and paternity leave, daycare etc.), there seem to be very few women doing what you have done. Why?    Lisa Lindstrom: My generation was not raised with a lot of references to female founders. When I was a kid, I had rarely heard of any founders, and the ones I heard of were male, like Ingvar Kamprad (founder of IKEA) and Stefan Persson (Chairman of H&M). My hope is that my kids will be raised with different perspectives, finding it natural to have women and men inventing and running companies. And I do believe that change is already happening! Swedish women in their 20s and 30s will be an enormous force in the tech world!   What's the worst standard career advice out there that you want women to stop believing?   Women always need to be a little bit better than the rest, give 200%. I'm a little bit tired of that saying. You don't need to be better. You just have to tell the world how good you are. Be proud of your skills and be loud about them.   How did you develop a style that's both feminine and authentic not trying to be a bad copy of a traditional male CEO?  My leadership style has evolved a lot through out the years. In the beginning the only thing I was confident about was my values and that I always wanted to have fun myself.  I basically tried to make decisions that were both driven by the purpose of our business, humanity and a large portion of creativity. It led me to constantly explore, ask for feedback, try new ways of working and be musical to what made the organization tick. I was so busy building the company I did not really have time to reflect if this was a female or male leadership style.   ""Culture"" is the buzzword in the workplace today. You've developed one of the most innovative, flexible work cultures I've ever explored at Doberman. Can you describe the values that underpin your culture and how you maintain it?  The cornerstornes of Doberman are participation, inclusion and a tireless dedication to talent.   What advice do you have to big corporations or startups that have become big companies to remain entrepreneurial and innovative?   A few things: Delegate more decisions to the parts of your organization that are closest to your customers; Create a culture of trust so that your organisation starts acting on customer input instead of management assignments.   Companies need to gain huge levels of trust in larger corporations and it takes practice. My experience is that some organisations need to practice outside the larger body, in an innovation lab. But, the most efficient way in my opinion is to train the organization within your existing structure, which entails building multi-disciplinary teams cross silos, giving them business-critical problems to solve, and a set time to solve them.   A company must make sure the team constantly prototypes, that it's constantly trying new ways of working, new processes, new products, and that they include their management in the feedback loops not just the final sign-off.   What have you sacrificed to get where you are?  The famous ""me-time"". And I am not even sure that it has been a sacrifice. It is something that I intellectually think I should do more of, but I am not sure it would make me more happy. My ""me-time"" is spent with my family. And yes, a few more things: reading enough, exercising enough and singing enough.  Do you think a woman can have it all?   Not all at once, but during a lifetime. Yes. If one tries to go all in for all of it at the same time, my view is that you tend to spend your energy thinking about the part where you are not delivering. But, if you are thankful for what you are doing, your energy will work with you along the way.  Do you have ""maternal guilt""? If yes, can you please give me some advice on how to deal with it since I am a perennial sufferer?  I feel like I'm always balancing between good-enough and guilt. And it's always in relation to my own definition of motherhood (whenever trying to figure out how to fit into the definition of the society I am living in I seem to fail more often).  My only advice is to set a few very strict rules for yourself and try to stick with them. Simple rules like:   - never work on Friday evenings, Saturdays and Sundays - spend long vacations with my family - involve my kids in important decisions that would involve me not being with them (for example: explaining to them why I am the chairman of certain boards, the purpose behind such work)  Does ""ambitious"" and ""mother"" blend? Can you be both?   Of course! But in some phases of your motherhood you cannot maximize on your ambition. It is like a volume button. Ambition also has several grades. Sometimes you can allow yourself a 10 and sometimes you just need to face it that you came to an 8.    You've been chosen by the Swedish government as an advisor on entrepreneurship-- What can governments and nations do to better spur innovation?  Governments should recognize that the main drivers for commercial innovation will always come from the companies themselves. The main task for a nation is to have the basic rights (competitive taxes, infrastructure, energy, rules, anti-corruption and all areas covered in the World Economic Forum's index for a competitive nation).  But to really spur innovation, a nation also needs to make sure it has an adaptive educational system, faster moving policy-making to adapt to new disruptive business models, such as the circular economy, and focus their research areas with a digital edge.   It also needs to collaborate with entrepreneurs, corporations, academia and citizens to become more innovative. Future successes come from the nations that build a platform of co-creation.  And lastly, a country needs to have a strong vision. Individuals, organizations and companies are always longing for a bigger purpose. If this could be communicated by a strong and co-created vision it would align all under-utilized capacity to work together for a move innovative, sustainable and successful nation.   Have you ever experienced gender bias? How did you respond?   My experiences are mainly positive. In the early days of digital product development, our clients were not always expecting me to be the one in charge, and I gained mostly positive reactions when they realized I was.   In the beginning it was more difficult to be young or without a university degree than being female. To whatever unfair expectations I have met, my response has always been to be outspoken with my ideas and trust that fairness and great ideas always win. Maybe it sounds naïve, but it has always saved me from reacting with emotion or frustration.  What does feminism mean to you?   Feminism means being gender conscious. It means always reflecting and being aware that we live in an unequal society and that we all have a responsibility to do what we can to change that. As a leader I have certain power to make decisions that affect equality and I need to act on that. Always.  So my version of feminism is the one of a practioner. I might not always be the one who has read all the books, but I am the one to make sure to be on stages and in visible public roles trying to prove that women are allowed to be on stages. At work, I always try to make the decision steeped in equality, recruit in a conscious way and promote talent in all aspects. Feminism by doing, is my mantra.   How do you work on equality in your company?  Just the fact that our Design Technology team explored how Artificial Intelligence could be used to promote gender equality is such a great sign that our company has a culture of dealing with important societal issues creatively and with commitment.   We also make sure there is equal pay for equal work, be very fair in recruitment and also focus on values and uplifting talent in anyway possible by offering men and women flexibility around family and work life. Pushing equal rights is always going to be one of our missions. That's why I'm so extra proud of the pledge for improved parental leave in the U.S. The rules need to be fair, when they are, then the competition is going to show results. I promise.  Women like Lisa are the reason I'm convinced that entrepreneurship is the ultimate form of empowerment. The modern ""women's liberation movement"" is echoed in every startup pitch and innovation lab where women are putting forth unique and novel ways to modernize the modern workplace and create cultures of innovation not regression.   I'm convinced the future is one where women will lead through their authentic personal stories, with their hearts and with their brilliant minds.  -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

3,Casey Williams,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/03/25/low-income-lifeline-internet-subsidy_n_9567090.html,"For Poor Americans, Getting Online Is About More Than Just Cheap Internet"," Internet access could soon get a whole lot cheaper for low-income Americans.  On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission will consider a proposal that would subsidize broadband Internet for low-income households. If it's adopted, eligible Americans could pay just $9.25 a month to get online. The measure would update the decades-old Lifeline subsidy, which provides discounted phone service for poor Americans. This could be a boon for the estimated 5 million American families who still lack Internet access. Groups who support the subsidy say it will help reverse inequalities in Internet use.  But for many poor Americans, getting by in an increasingly digitized world will require more than cheap Internet, experts say. ""There's a whole range of other factors that determine whether you benefit or not from Internet access,"" Blanca Gordo, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, told The Huffington Post.  More than half of low-income Americans with Internet access complain that it's slow, and a quarter say they share a computer with too many other people, according to a recent study.  In addition, some people have no computer access at all. For many poor Americans, a cell phone is their only portal to the Internet, according to Laura Robinson, an assistant professor of sociology at Santa Clara University. That puts them at a serious disadvantage, she said.  ""Think about typing your resume on a smartphone and trying to get a job with it,"" Robinson told HuffPost ""You can update your linked in page, but can you update your cover letter?""  People with low incomes also tend to lack experience using the Internet, according to Gordo. ""We take for granted how much time it has taken for us to learn [how to use the Internet],"" Gordo explained. ""If you entered this system the '90s, you have developed some awareness of how it functions. But if you’re a new entrant, there’s a lot to learn."" Without the knowledge that comes from experience, it's difficult for people to develop the confidence and skills needed to use the Internet effectively, Robinson said.   Having access without experience is like having car keys but not knowing how to drive, Robertson explained. You might technically be able to get behind the wheel, ""but you expend so much emotional energy to operate the vehicle, that you can’t look out the window,"" she said.   I cannot believe that in 2016 we’re still wondering if Internet access is a need, when everyday, everywhere you’re required to go online. Blanca Gordo, researcher at UC Berkeley   For Robinson, experience and confidence are more important than the quality of one's Internet connection.  ""If you take someone who is confident [in their ability to use the Internet] and say, 'You have dial-up for the day,' they would say, 'Gee, that sucks,' but they would know how to optimize,"" Robinson said.  For someone who hasn't spent much time on the Internet, she said, ""they might do just as badly with all of the resources in the world."" Not being able to use the Internet effectively comes with financial and social costs. Products often cost more in stores than online, and a growing number of basic activities, including applying for jobs and signing up for government services, require people to use the Internet, according to Gordo.  ""I cannot believe that in 2016 we’re still wondering if Internet access is a need, when everyday, everywhere you’re required to go online,"" Gordo said.  The government's proposed broadband subsidy is a necessary step toward greater digital equality, Gordo added. ""But this should have happened long ago."" Robinson agrees. The stakes are high, she said. ""For poor families, it's still 'We can’t eat if we’re paying for Internet.'""  -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

4,Charles Edge,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-edge/the-importance-of-having-_2_b_9563304.html,The Importance Of Having A Good Content Strategy For Small Businesses,"Search engine optimization (SEO) involves strategies and techniques that, when used properly, increases the amount of people that come to your website via search engines, like Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft Bing. Getting enough content, and more importantly the right content, on your site is your content strategy. As a business owner you always need to try new, interesting, and interactive ways to promote your company. And one of the best things you can do is to create a good content strategy for your organization's website.   A business owner, or marketing employee in a small business is likely to wear a lot of hats. In large companies, there are often teams of people creating, editing, releasing, and strategizing what content to create on a website. How does a smaller organization compete for a similar audience? A good content strategy at a small business can help keep you focused and provide a unique experience to your readers. You can get material out faster than if articles have to pass through multiple layers of approval before going public. Timely pieces can mean getting to audiences before the competition can catch up. And having a personable and authentic voice can keep readers coming back to your site.   Not only does a good content strategy allow you to take your business to the next level, but it also offers a wide range of other benefits, as you can see below!  You get to be a little more data driven I've always started with Google, using Google Analytics and Google AdWords or terms used to locate your site and competitor sites. This provides you with the real words and terms that people use to find services like yours. This isn't to say to be inauthentic or tailor your content to a market you aren't interested in reaching just to drive up numbers (very specifically - don't do that); instead look to use a little market research to help guide the development of your product and reach a larger audience. You can also use this data to help inspire your employees to get behind your initiatives.  You offer a specific goal and meaning to your content By creating a good content strategy, you will have the unique opportunity to offer meaning to your content and make it fulfill your business goal. The content will be branded and it will be offering you a better exposure in the online world.  You save energy and time Once you have a content strategy in place you know how to create content as well as the content types that work best in your industry. You know how to save energy and time as well, something that will boost your business quite a lot in the end. But more specifically, a content strategy will enable you to focus your efforts in the places that reach your specific demographic and customer in a way that is meaningful to the both of you.   You understand how you can use existing content I find that when people start writing content, the content can be disjointed, or confusing for readers. This actually helps you initially, by allowing you to see the search terms people find that content and have an initial starting point to research what words and styles to focus your efforts on for future content. But once you implement a good content strategy, existing content can be repurposed and edited to align with your new strategy. Aligning your content to the right audience with a good message lets you refine your understanding of how the content works as a whole.  You get a more unified marketing package Smaller content pieces are hard to use as a marketing tool individually, but once you add them together you get a more cohesive and unified marketing package. You can use this package to get a better experience and a high quality result in the end, which is crucial to say the least.  You get an SEO boost A good content strategy will benefit your SEO. With high quality and optimized content produced and shared regularly, your site will definitely be able to improve the search engine ranking and reach more of your target audience, or persona. While it's super-satisfying to search for a term and see your company at the top of the list, keep in mind that it's better to be a little further down for a search term that is pertinent to customers you want to reach than at the top of the list for visitors that will simply distract you from reaching those customers. As with a lot of things in business, leave the ego at the door and focus on results.  You get diversity Using optimized static pages, blog posts, infographics, and video, you can reach entirely different people. There is a growing demand for ways to digest information more quickly than reading mostly text-based articles. Posting Infographics from your site on Pinterest or embedding videos from your YouTube channel can drive new types of traffic to your site. These are people who share interests that might become customers, but who don't access data in the same way you might.   It encourages you to create content more often Writing content often can be a challenge for businesses, but having a content strategy will help push you more and more towards the idea of improving your content and taking your strategy to the next level. It's also a lot easier to write content when you don't have to think of ideas. If you sit down and plan a content calendar quarterly, weekly, or monthly, you will find inspiration in those random hours you accidentally reclaim when a meeting cancels.  Your product can take on a personality and style Content can easily be tracked and managed. You can measure the success of your content by how it drives potential customers through a funnel. You can even see the amount of sales that each piece generates. But there are softer returns on the investment into content. When done right, your content starts to give your product personality. Maybe your a dentist for small children and your content is soft and parental, or maybe you're an internet startup and you want your content to be cheeky and fun. Whatever the personality is, make it intentional, and don't make it seem inauthentic, or you will end up disengaging your readers, watchers, viewers, etc. If your content isn't authentic but is meant for your audience, rethink your personas.   Your readers know when to expect content You can look at the logs of your site and see when the optimal time to release new content is. Maybe you get a spike in readership on Tuesday at 10:00am. If you release new content then, your target audience is likely to be higher, as other similar people are engaging with that type of content at that time. Getting into a regular cadence with your content not only puts you in touch with people when they're likely to see your content, but it also lets them know that you're going to be there for them on a regular basis.  In conclusion, a good content strategy can really boost your business and take it to the next level. It all comes down to you to choose the content type and keywords, but based on the choices you make you can access some incredible results. Just try to experiment with a wide range of content strategies, then you are bound to have an incredible outcome! -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

5,Kirill Chekanov,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kirill-chekanov/the-wearable-generation_b_9565132.html,The Wearable Generation,"Hey HuffPost, my name is Kirill, I'm a 20 y.o. Russian entrepreneur based in Belfast, NI now.  Started my very first company when I was 14, my first venture funded project at 17. Now working on Chill with my lads Greg and Ilia.  I personally am in wearables for more than 3 years- on my previous company we were one of the first to build a Google Glass app in Russia which got me to speak to a lot of wearable device owners (GoogleGlass and Pebble back then) and discover what their biggest pains were.  Before reading any further please ask yourself: When does a generation change happen from your perspective? (seriously, let me know in comments)  From my perspective I saw several generations change through my life: the laptop gen, the mobile gen and now the wearable gen.  Every time a screen changes its size we see a certain group of people change their behaviour dramatically. So for me a driver for a generation to change in the 21 century is the screen size.  The easiest way to identify one is to look at you family (lets look at mine):  My granny -- totally laptop gen. Uses email over her 15 inch Sony (just don't forget I'm 20 so my granny is a 20 year old's granny, haha). Probably a lot of your grannies (assuming you are bit older than me) are pen&paper gen.  My mom -- mobile gen. Uses Twitter over the screen of her phone and uses the same format to communicate over her laptop.  Twitter brought a new communication experience to the mobile gen. Now 140 symbol messages are pretty much normal.  Please get me right- I'm not telling that mobile gen uses ""smartphones only"". A generation is not about a device- it's about the pattern new screens bring to our lives. For instance not only communication changed with the introduction of smaller smartphone screens. News consumption also evaluated. Many people just rush through headlines to stay in the context of what's going on without reading the article itself. Pretty much what we do on Twitter, right?  The wearable generation is here and Twitter's 140 symbols is just too much for a Millennial to handle (lets assume they are the early wearable tech adopters).  Don't get confused: Millennilas and the wearable gen are different people. Millennials are in the middle of generations. Lets say, I (guess a Millennial) still think of wearables as of the future. The kids who are 13 year old now will think of wearables same as we think about iPhones -- normal. Never the less Millennials are the ones who will be forming the wearable culture in its first stages.  A lot of patterns these guys create for wearables- will be brought to the smartphone screens and change our online behaviour in the next few years.  For the wearable generation, lockscreen-- is the new interface. Communication, news, apps- all that is going to be happening mainly without your app getting opened.  We are moving to a ""at a glance"" communication format where 140 symbols -- is a long read. The one who creates a language to optimise wearable communication- gets it all.  --  Hope you enjoyed the read. This is one of a series of posts I am planning to share with you where I will be digging more into the wearable generation and its' cultural aspects. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

6,Laura Dambrosio,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laura-dambrosio/machine-learning-as-a-ser_b_9548962.html,Machine Learning as a Service: How Data Science Is Hitting the Masses,"Machine learning is an enigma to most. For decades it's a been a field dominated by scientists and the few organizations with enough computing power to run complex algorithms against huge datasets. But now the world of machine learning and predictive analytics is opening up to developers and companies of all sizes, with machine learning (ML) providers offering their products through a subscription-based model or open sourcing some of their technology.  These new ML providers comprise a predictive analytics industry worth anything between $5-10 billion, depending on the source. There's something for everyone: a developer who wants to build predictive analytics into their application, a customer success team that needs to know which accounts are likely to churn, a data scientist looking to run models on faster and cheaper infrastructure. These people can now shop for the machine learning product of their choice—a farfetched idea just several years ago.  The Perfect Convergence of Ability and Demand  In just the last few years, over 90% of all the data in the world was created. NoSQL databases got popular, SQL got faster, and projects like Apache Spark did wonders for the speed and performance of large-scale data processing. Suddenly we had mountains of data and a fast, affordable means of drawing insight from it.   ML providers are taking advantage of that. Some have been in the industry for years—take Apigee's CTO, Anant Jhingran. Jhingran was VP and CTO for IBM's Information Management Division, working closely on groundbreaking data projects like Watson. Today his team at Apigee uses predictive technology to help developers build apps that can learn from the constant stream of user data flowing through APIs. They have customers in almost every major industry using their predictive technology to do things like detect fraud or show personalized shopping recommendations to end users.    ""It's the era of cheap computing and cheap memory.""   H2O.ai's Vinod Iyengar is another player in ML market. He's Director of Marketing for the open source machine learning company that was first venture-backed in 2013. Iyengar sees a high demand for predictive in many industries, explaining that ""there's a huge need to be filled"".  ""The amount of data available has shot up exponentially"", Iyengar says. ""Enormous amounts are being collected and stored every day thanks to cheaper costs of storage and cloud computing. Once that happens, you can't use your old algorithms on these large datasets. All of the different platforms, Hadoop, Spark, are starting to chip away at this problem. It's the era of cheap computing and cheap memory.""   H2O is entirely open source. It lets developers use its technology stack to process large amounts of data and run it through H2O's algorithms to make predictions. Like the many other open source projects in the field, it's completely free if you only use the community resources. This flexibility opens up opportunities for companies of all sizes—from those experimenting to those ready to make a real investment in machine learning.  How APIs and Open Source are Democratizing Data  Two things pose a threat to actually putting machine learning to work: poor data quality and lack of data integration. The improvement of APIs and the trend of open sourcing some or all of the technology stack can abolish those threats.  Jhingran, whose core business is in developing and managing better APIs, believes that the real power for digital transformation lies in the apps. ""Today's apps need to learn and adapt"", he says, ""and to do that there needs to be a consistent data stream of signals about the behaviors and actions of the end users from all channels of engagement. You can use the data to generate really deep insights with machine learning, then feed the results back into the apps to make improvements.""  This is important because before APIs were this intelligent or ubiquitous, a company only had access to a small portion of user data that happened on its own website or platform. They had to make guesses on what was working without information from data sources like email campaigns, iOS apps, payment platforms, or any number of places where users were having important interactions. And as Jhingran summarizes perfectly, ""There's no way you can run a machine learning algorithm on such limited inputs.""  While APIs are connecting data from many sources and putting it to work, the open source movement is giving anyone the chance to use the collective knowledge from data scientists and developers who have been working in this field. H2O's platform and algorithms are all open source, Iyengar explains. ""All of H2O is exposed via a REST API. Data scientists and developers can choose the language and environment that works best for them. If our customers need more guidance, that's another level of support that we provide.""  There are tons of other open source projects on github that developers can use to incorporate machine learning into their applications. And companies like Google are releasing lower-level libraries like Tensorflow, which can be used in conjunction with others to perfectly match the level of sophistication a developer or data scientist is looking for. Even the less-technical user can take advantage of a service like Amazon Machine Learning, which provides a simple UI for non-developers.  Now the crossroads: If APIs and the open source community are making machine learning technology accessible to all, why not hire data scientists of your own and get to work?  Why Not Just Hire Your Own Data Scientists?  As machine learning gets more popular as a service, companies will have to decide at what level they want to be involved. ""Having a scientist in house or not is a decision most companies will have to make"", Jhingran predicts. ""The power of predictive is so high. But wanting to do it and being able to do it are two different things. Some companies will choose a platform like ours to manage the entire cycle of data intelligence instead of trying to do it in-house, and that will let them focus on developing and powering their applications.""  Iyengar agrees. ""There are only so many PhDs"", he says, ""and while there's huge hype for data scientists right now, there's a limited number of potential hires out there. Right now there is still a lot of manual decision-making involved in machine learning, and you should either begin your search now or find a partner you trust.""   ""There are only so many PhDs.""   Like many in the predictive market, Iyengar believes it's good to do some of the leg work in-house if you're going to adopt predictive. But there's a reason his company and others like it are hired to manage the data. It's not easy to do it without the talent, infrastructure, and scalability that ML providers have found.   Data scientists are growing in number, but only in the tens of thousands...   ...and thousands are going to work for the top companies. There may not be enough to go around.   Navigating a Booming Market  If you decide to shop around for good machine learning provider, you'll need to ask the right questions. You can get oriented by checking out Zachary Chase Lipton's series of articles that compare some of the major vendors.   A good vendor should be able to explain both how they manage data and how they solve your specific business problem. Iyengar suggests asking some questions to see if a predictive company will be a good fit: ""Ask a [ML provider] how they handle unclean data. Their answer will show you how well they know their work. You can also ask about the variety of algorithms they use, since they should have a good variety of fairly robust algorithms. They should be comfortable explaining how they deploy a model structure, what their web stack looks like, and how that will work with customer architecture.""   Jhingran expects the main differentiator among competing ML providers will be on how they apply the technology to improve applications and business strategy. ""It's astounding how the art of data science has improved over a short time thanks to open source. Over time, the competitive position you have from your own 'secret sauce' algorithms will dwindle—it will be all about how easily the models can be used by both scientists and developers to impact the organization.""  Machine learning and predictive techniques impact every major industry. It may soon be an essential line item in most companies' budgets. But here's a dirty secret: no matter how good the algorithm, no matter how good the scientist, the models can't perform magic.   ""No data in, no science out,"" jokes Jhingran. Whoever has the best sense for choosing, organizing, and acting on the torrent of incoming customer data might end up with the best long-term outlook in a market that's just getting started. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

7,Rebecca Costa,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rebecca-costa/are-you-ready-for-sensorw_b_9558588.html,Are You Ready for SensorWorld?,"  Sensors, sensors, everywhere sensors. In our clothes, our shoes, air conditioners, cars, diapers and beds. And what are all these sensors doing? They're collecting and analyzing data of course - billions of discrete pieces of information every picosecond of every day so we can, a) make informed decisions and, b) automate all of the things connected by the IoT (Internet of Things). Soon sensors embedded in my pajamas will determine I'm dehydrated from having a little too much fun the night before, then send a message to the 3-D food printer in my kitchen to make a drink designed to replenish my electrolytes. Sensors will also heat my house the minute my car heads for home and tell me when my 16-year old is driving over the speed limit.   Sound far-fetched? It shouldn't.   Recently, Senior Editor of Wired Magazine, Bill Wasik, reported, ""A new device revolution is at hand: just as mobile phones and tablets displaced the once-dominant PC, wearable devices are poised to push smartphones aside."" In truth, the U.S. sensor market is expected to surpass $15 billion in 2016, causing On World to forecast that by 2017, global shipments of wearable, implantable, and mobile health and fitness devices will be up 552% from 2012.   Welcome to SensorWorld.  Now sensors and data analytics are preparing to go where 'no man has gone before.' Tackling an activity we spend a third of our lives ignoring: sleep! Why sleep? The National Sleep Foundation reports that 43% of Americans rarely get a good night's sleep, and 60% experience a sleep problem almost every night. A recent Gallup poll revealed that since 1942, the amount of sleep we get has decreased roughly a half an hour per night and continues to trend downward. And the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) claims over 9 million Americans currently rely on a pharmaceutical to fall asleep.  According to technology pioneer, and inventor of the world's first camera phone, Philippe Kahn, our growing problem with sleep began during the Industrial Revolution when ""the mythical eight-hour sleep night"" was fabricated to extract longer hours from factory workers. ""Before the Industrial Revolution,"" Kahn explained, ""people were mostly sleeping in two shifts... nobody was really sleeping eight hours straight."" He continued, ""The concept that we have to sleep in uninterrupted ways all the time, in a perfectly quiet environment, in a perfectly dark room... to me is a misconception and something that is misleading people to understand how to optimize their sleep.""   Kahn stumbled on the idea of ""budgeting"" sleep on a record-setting, two-man Transpacific sailing trip in 2009. With a two-person crew, each person is allowed to sleep for only brief periods of time. So Kahn decided to use his sailboat as a laboratory to determine the amount of sleep that produced the highest levels of alertness and energy. He discovered that number was twenty-six minutes. From that point on Kahn began modeling his sleep after his dog - short periods of deep rest with the ability to wake at a moment's notice in a high state of ""readiness,"" and then quickly return to a deep sleep. Kahn claims that from an evolutionary standpoint this is the way humans were designed to sleep - they function best when sleep is ""budgeted"" for, and ""optimized,"" in the same way we do investment planning - only when it comes to sleep, returns are measured in terms of health and productivity.  Enter Kahn's latest breakthrough in sensor and data analytics technology: the Smart Bed. The Smart Bed replaces the traditional ""box-spring"" with a sensor-based unit designed to monitor movement, body temperature and other metrics so we can optimize when and how much we sleep. The Smart Bed and Sleep Tracker was developed by Kahn's company Fullpower - an enterprise focused on precise, non-invasive data monitoring and analysis. According to Kahn, sleep was a logical application for his company because of the number of hours humans spend sleeping, the mythology surrounding the need for a continuous eight-hour rest, and his personal revelations while sailing. Kahn observes, ""Sleep is a bit like the deep ocean. We know it is there but we don't understand it well. Modern science doesn't understand sleep very well because it is very difficult to monitor sleep in a non-invasive way."" With the new Smart Bed, Kahn is poised to revolutionize the way humans rest and the effect this will have on efficiency, output, health and ultimately, longevity.   While Fullpower is pushing the frontiers of sleep technology, other companies are leveraging sensor and data analytics technologies to optimize other areas. Pixie Scientific, is embedding sensors into ""smart diapers"" that will allow diseases, dehydration and nutritional deficiencies to be detected in diapers. Intel's new Smart Band tracks, monitors and analyzes the tremor patterns of Parkinson's patients, and a new generation of smart pills and monitoring patches from Proteus are in the works. Peter Reinhart, Director of the Institute for Applied Life Sciences for the University of Massachusetts recently revealed that sensor technologies would soon shift from diagnosis to treatment, ""As we get better and better at this, we're going to find that new therapeutic options are going to be open to us. Identifying an Alzheimer's patient at the [observable] behavioral point, when 70 percent of the brain mass has already disappeared, really limits the number of therapeutic options you can provide that patient. If you could identify someone like that seven or eight years earlier, it now opens up a very different array of intervention strategies.""  But, as Kahn points out, collecting and translating data is only half the story. The other half is connecting to devices, which will be automatically instructed by the analyzed data. Google's Nest offers a home app that uses sensors, analytics and the internet to connect everything from your thermostat to your fire alarms and home security system. Apple has launched a similar IoT application called HomeKit. According to Kahn, the Smart Bed will have the ability to turn your bedroom thermostat down when your body is at rest and turn the heat back up when the bed senses you are waking. It will lift the shades in your bedroom, signal the hot water heater to ready the shower, and the coffee machine to prepare your coffee just the way you like it. And if that sounds like the stuff of science fiction, look again. Theo Priestly, technology strategist and Forbes contributor claims the IoT will be comprised of 50 billion interconnected devices before 2020 - representing a whopping $19 trillion market. Fitbit, smart watches, smart clothing, diapers and beds are just the beginning. Within the next five years, sensors will monitor, customize and automate everything.

8,Sofia Katsali,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sofia-katsali/post_11187_b_9555794.html,"Own Influencer Marketing, Don't Let It Own You: An Interview With Nicolas Chabot, VP EMEA Of Traackr","Influencer marketing is here to stay. An entire industry is being formed around this form of advertising, so the sooner you grasp how it can work for your brand and/or organization, the better. You may have heard of it as Fortune 500 companies like to call it; native advertising. Content focused companies call it advertorials but I like to call it influence outreach. This is not directly associated with sponsored content such as promoted posts, sponsored tweets and products. These are tools built directly in social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.  Truth is, these social media powerhouses are not what they used to be. What once were digital hangout corners for family and friends to stay in touch, have now turned into enormously-crafted advertising platforms ready to target audiences with remarkable accuracy. These very same channels are used to broadcast information from all sorts of bloggers, celebrities and public figures promoting content around the world. But not all content is created equal. With digital influencers out there reaching a respectable amount of people (could be hundreds of thousands to millions) within niche demographics, they have now caught advertisers' attention.    The silver lining between brands creating content and brands creating ads designed to look like content (hello branded content) has been crossed a long time ago. In addition to your mobile, content, e-mail marketing, display advertising and SEO efforts, the time has come to roll the dice and play the game with social influencers.  So, how can your brand benefit from influencer marketing? I spoke with Nicolas Chabot, VP EMEA of Traackr, the first influencer marketing platform to launch that remains a challenger in the market shaking up current practice. What I especially love about Traackr is its primary focus on helping marketers understand the full potential on influencer marketing and its enthusiasm in nurturing their influencer marketing expertise.  SK: Tell us about Traackr and its unique approach to influencer marketing.  NC: Traackr is the leading and fastest growing global Influencer Marketing platform with influencers tracked across 17 social platforms and available across 11 searchable languages and already indexing content in 45 languages.  When we set up in 2009, Traackr's vision for the future of marketing was instrumental in creating the Influencer Marketing category and it led the way for brands to optimize their investment therein. Our innovative technology and advanced professional services that support customer execution stand alone in providing marketers with an all-in-one Influencer Marketing solution and the industry's most extensive and strategic set of capabilities.  Our vision is centered on the importance of building long-term relationships with influencers so brands can generate a sustainable impact, rather than one-off peaks of activity. It's exactly like in real life, brands shouldn't treat influencers like a one-night stand the same way you wouldn't ask someone to marry you after the first date. For this reason we encourage clients to develop always-on programs so campaigns become activation points but the relationship is ongoing.   Building relationships takes time and requires nurturing but ultimately, ""always-on"" programs show great value and a higher return on investment for brands, because it is much more cost-effective to maintain and build on an existing relationship, than to build one from scratch.  Traackr goes much beyond fancy analytics and aims to become an IRM (Influencer Relationship Management) platform, which is the place where brands manage their relationships with influencers, in the same way that CRM is where client relationships are managed.  SK: Why do you think social media influencers are the future? How are they driving consumer purchase behavior contrary to brands and organizations?  NC: It simply comes down to the fact that people don't trust brands anymore, people trust people. Nielsen quotes that today's consumer 'trust' is based primarily on authoritative content (peer recommendations, bloggers and reviews) which comes at 51% with brand content coming in 2nd position with 27% and advertising in 3rd with 22%.   But the key insight is that very very few people drive conversations and engagement. We estimate that only 3% of individuals in a conversation create around 90% of the impact. That means that focusing on those few individuals enables brands to concentrate resource, build deeper relationships and optimize the ROI of their social media investments.  This leads us to believe that Influencer Marketing is today the only means by which brands can truly harness relationships with connected consumers, build equity and deliver tangible marketing impact.  Influencers are not necessarily the customers or prospects of the brand but the individuals who can sway the behaviour or shape the opinions of others through their online conversations and interactions to the benefit of a given brand. Their value to a brand is not their wallet but lies in their voice as the power of peer-to-peer influence and word-of-mouth is now recognized as one of the single most impactful means of customer on-boarding.   The KPIs that a brand will look at for an influencer program will be the number of mentions, the share of voice, the generated traffic or leads; indicators that would normally demonstrate how the program contributed to the overall visibility and advocacy of the brand.  Credit: Traackr  SK: You are a firm believer of the cross-functionality of influencer marketing. What are the benefits of integrating influencer marketing into the overall digital strategy of a brand?  NC: I think this is really the revolution digital and social media have brought to the table. When individuals get in touch with a brand on social, they don't differentiate which department they are speaking to, they expect to hear one voice only from a brand. Therefore organizations have to break internal silos as it is the brand's responsibility to build bridges within the organization that enable it to speak consistently across all touch points.  This applies the same way to influencer relations and even more so because influencers can be industry experts but also customers, fans, detractors, employees etc. The evolution of cross-functional influencer programs was initiated within marketing departments, as influencer strategies started to be identified across corporate communications, social media marketing, performance marketing and CRM. Now we can clearly foresee influencer programs expanding to other areas of an organization such as customer care, product marketing and HR.  The multi-dimensional aspect of influencer relations creates major challenges for organizations:  • Maintaining consistent brand voice across multi-organizational touch points with the same influencers. Consistent brand messaging across channels can be achieved through robust content and publication management processes; however this is extremely challenging when you engage in real 1 to 1 relationships with influencers.  • Managing different types of influencers requires building specific plans and activation programs. For example, influencers who have an impact on your corporate social responsibility reputation deserve entirely different engagement mechanisms than your most influential fans on Instagram. • KPIs and measurement need to be tailored to fit each program. There is not one single answer for measuring the success of all your influencer programs. For example, the performance marketing teams will be tracking such as shared links and impact on SEO while social media managers will be looking at positive mentions and user generated content from top influencers.  Brands that manage to evolve to a cross-functional influencer model will reap huge benefits in terms of advocacy overall, which will ultimately translate into commercial results.   SK: How does Traackr help smooth the communicating process between marketers and social media influencers? What commercial benefits do marketers miss out if they don't use your platform?  NC: Many brands are now undertaking influencer marketing but many are still doing the work manually using spreadsheets and building Twitter lists. This really doesn't help developing an integrated influence strategy, building long-term relationships and always-on programs that generate sustainable impact. I am not even speaking about the time spent doing all of this manually and the loss of knowledge when staff leaves.   Our technology enables brands to optimize and scale their influencer programs by identifying individuals with the highest signal for a brand or product, uncovering authentic social insights to build meaningful relationships, facilitating the activation of those influencers, and measuring their impact on the brand. We like to say that Traackr's technology helps brands to move from an empiric approach of influencer marketing to a real influencer strategy and to industrialize 1-on-1 relationships.   Our conversation engine aggregates influencers' publications across channels and enables the marketer to listen to and understand each influencer even before speaking to them. It also helps the marketer identify engagement opportunities and approach influencers the right way at the right time with the right content.   Our CRM capability will help the marketer keep track of the relationship history whether on social media, emails and manual notes. And indeed our analytic section will help measure in real time the success of each activation but also of the program as a whole.  Credit: Traackr  SK: From 1 to 10, how satisfied are you with the current status of the influencer market in the digital world and why?  NC: Right now, I'd give it a 6 but I am hopeful to move it to 7 soon. We've seen a huge and growing interest in Influencer Marketing the last few years. According to Google Trends, search interest has doubled from 2014 to 2015 and already risen 30% so far this year. Amongst our clients, we've seen leading brands increase investment up to 10 times year-on-year, from $100's of thousands to millions in Influencer Marketing.   However, there are really two paths being followed, one good, the other one not so good. The first one and the one that we are promoting is based on long-term win-win and authentic relationships that will help brands generate more and more impact over time. In this case, brands will not necessarily focus on influencers who have the biggest reach but the one that really generate conversations and engagement within their communities. The other one is a more tactical approach to influencer marketing where influencers become another media channel for brands. Influencers are paid to endorse a brand or a product like a celebrity would be. Generally the impact generated is very short term and the relationship stops when money stops coming in. This is not what we call influencer marketing but advertising pure and simple.   Fortunately, this is about to change with more transparency being asked for and the recent FTC enforcement against Lord & Taylor.   More generally we see everyday that even the most advanced brands have yet to build up their expertise and experience in creating successful programs: the science of influencer marketing is only being built as we speak by the smart marketers.  SK: What's in it for the social media influencers? Do you approach them directly and if so how has their experience with Traackr been?  NC: The What's In It For Me is indeed very important. Real influencers have generally worked very hard to build their audience and gain credibility and they wouldn't want to damage this by associating with the wrong brand or product.   Generally, influencers will look how they can benefit from the relationships in ways that will help them expand their community, educate their audience and assert their authority on the topic. Content plays a big part in this whether in creating content that they will find interesting and share, featuring them or collaborating to create content, inviting them to speak at events etc. Any kind of money can't buy opportunities, exclusive access, product loan etc. is also generally much appreciated. Overall, influencers like to be involved so it's very important to make them feel part and for the long haul. This is what we are observing ourselves as we tend to practice what we preach and influencer marketing is the operating system for our marketing efforts.   In terms of paying influencers, the debate is open and it is only natural that ""professional influencers"" look to monetize their audience. We like to say that one should 'pay for the craft, not for the influence' but we recognize that different models will co-exist.  To be clear, Traackr is not a marketplace and we do not interact with influencers directly. It is up top the brand to set their strategy and engage. Traackr enables brands then to track, manage and measure the impact of their actions, be they paid or not.  Credit: Traackr  SK: You are about to launch ""Academy of Influencer Marketing"", a first-of-a-kind rich multimedia e-learning course that aims to educate marketing professionals about the fundamental pillars of influencer marketing. Could you tell us more about it and what are you hoping to achieve with it?  NC: Influencer marketing is very new and as with every new discipline, there is a lack of expertise, knowledge and skills. The comprehensive course provides a range of expert insights and a complete overview of all essential elements of Influencer Marketing practice, interviews, case studies and white papers providing a framework for optimal execution and ROI.  Devised by our team and global IM professional, trainer and educator, Shonali Burke, the Academy of Influencer Marketing aims to raise the game and skill set of forward-thinking marketers and drive education and innovation in Influencer Marketing practice. AIM will equip marketers with industry leading tools, the vision and know-how to achieve best practice and successfully navigate the increasingly fragmented digital landscape.   The course brings together unique expert insights and step-by-step guidance through Traackr's 4 pillars of strategic Influencer Marketing practice: accurate influencer identification, influencer engagement, program scaling and accurate measurement. It provides a pathway through the key pitfalls and barriers to optimal Influencer Marketing execution, management and scalability. It demonstrates how to ensure and evidence best ROI and performance through every element of this powerful new marketing practice.  We've basically decided to invest in helping all marketers, not just our customers, get smarter and to acquire the proficiency a marketer needs to succeed with Influencer Marketing.   Note: Traackr's Academy of Influencer Marketing (AIM) is available here.  SK: If you could give one piece of advice to brands in regards to content marketing, what would it be?  NC: Creating content takes a lot of resources both in terms of budget and time so my advice would be: Don't create content for content's sake!  Content marketing involves creation and distribution so brands need to think about dissemination when creating their content and spend pretty much as much resources on one and the other.   We believe content marketing and influencer strategy must work together for either to be successful. 90% of the world's data has been generated in the past 2 years; and while content marketing is approaching mass adoption, getting a message in front of the right people at the right time is as formidable as it is essential. To rise above the noise, convey a message and mobilize buyers, content marketers are turning to influencers.

As it turns out, the industry had to go forward before going backward, starting with manual buying, according to Megan Pagliuca, Accuen's Global CEO. Then came ad networks, which made programmatic buying easier because of their mass reach.  ""The challenge with that model was that the ad network was arbitraging and not working on behalf the advertiser agency or the publisher,"" Pagliuca says during a break at the annual Transformation conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. ""What we're ultimately getting back to is where we started, with advertisers and agencies have direct relationships with publishers. Direct relationships has always been the intent.""  Two keys to the continued evolution of programmatic are transparency issues with clients regarding supply chain costs and getting smarter about programmatic planning. The latter issue has its roots in the genesis of agency trading desks.  ""Essentially you had a separate unit and this budget is kind of thrown over the fence at that unit and no one's really thinking about programmatic planning or audience-driven planning,"" Pagliuca says. ""The implication was programmatic was just a line item on the media plan rather than actually planning within programmatic.""  Pagliuca welcomes header bidding, noting that many direct buys do not happen in the programmatic marketplace. This year, Accuen is focused on migrating a lot of its direct IO buys into programmatic.  ""Header bidding facilitates that in a way that we weren't able to do before,"" she says. ""Being able to have first look to premium inventory without actually having a passback. We're eager for more publishers to adopt header bidding and have it as a critical part of our strategy.""

Europe has more than 30 million migrants with the number increasing all the time. Migrants are making headlines for the wrong reasons at the moment with almost 750,000 estimated to had arrived in Europe by the sea in 2015. [1] As refugee crisis unfolds there is a danger it will undermine the vital contributions working migrants make to domestic economies.  5-7% of Europe's GDP comes from remittances  On average, a migrant worker in Europe sends around USD 12,000 home every year. This is effectively a minimum salary back in their home country, where the average wage is around USD 20,000 a year. Sending money home, or remittances, are one of the most stable sources of finance and, unlike private investment, these funds often increase economic problems. Between 5 percent and 7 percent of Europe's GDP comes from remittances. [2]  In Britain, migrants dominate mid-level jobs  People are moving abroad for various reasons. Many of them have been forced to leave their home countries due to local atrocities, others have chosen to leave their home after the financial crises, which for example led to the collapse of the entire industry, forcing many people out of their jobs. That has happened to Elena Nebunelea, who while living in the Romanian city of Vaslui, was working as an insurance trader and leading a team of 15 people. ""I had a well-established career and a lot of responsibility, but unexpected legislative changes during the crisis lead to the absolute chaos and forced the company out of the market leaving thousands of well-respected and hard-working people jobless"" - says Elena.   After battling poor economic conditions back home, she, together with her spouse, has decided to move to the UK, where for the past six months she has been working as a cleaner. The couple's daughter is still living in Romania with her grandparents. Elena is a great example of many over-qualified and well-educated people who due to certain economic conditions had to leave their home country just so they can provide for their family members that are left behind and save in order to ensure the better quality of life for when she says she will eventually go back to Romania. Elena and her husband both send money back to Romania every month and there are many more people like her. The woman says that it's enough to live and save from what she's earning now as a cleaner, nevertheless, she is also attempting to start anew by studying to get accounting certificates in the UK. This in order to apply for more qualified and better-paid jobs, better matching her previous experience and career goals.  In Britain, migrants, such as Elena, dominate mid-level jobs in the service industries and power manufacturing and production sectors. They have National Insurance Numbers and pay UK tax. They can also earn between four and six times more than in their home country, which allows them to send this money home.  The price of sending money has been inflated  Experts suggest that the price of sending money has been inflated by companies such as MoneyGram and Western Union, which have a duopoly on the market. Transfer fees with companies such as these can be as high as 29 percent. [3] Therefore, people like Elena need to look for some other option to send their money home, which could guarantee not only lower prices but also would be reliable and secure. Sometimes, the most important thing is for the money to receive the recipient as quickly as possible, especially if the recipients are depending on it to pay bills. New remittance field players such as TransferGo, employ the most innovative payment solutions not only to fight against the risen costs but also to enable same day purchasing power, that has a transformative impact on the lives of the families.  Daumantas Dvilinskas, CEO and co-founder of TransferGo said: ""This money that people send home is the difference between barely making ends meet and entering a middle-class lifestyle. Only a couple of years after our journey began, blue-collar migrants can now save more than 90 percent on their transfer costs and can deliver money to their families on the same business day, which is a huge step forward.""  Global remittances will rise to USD $681 billion  By the end of 2016, the World Bank projects that global remittances will rise to USD $681 billion. With more and more people moving places and looking for a higher quality of life, remittance is almost an inseparable part of lives of migrants. Dilip Ratha, CEO of KNOMAD, a World Bank initiative that organises data and knowledge on migration, said at a TED talk in 2014: ""Remittances fund education, healthcare, business investments, surgery, weddings and funerals that senders cannot attend."" [4] Therefore, it's very important to create services that helps to reduce fees for migrants around the world, while also ensuring that their money gets home safely and preferably on the same day.

11,Professor Mark Skilton,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/professor-mark-skilton/the-fbi-versus-apple-case_b_9561144.html,The FBI versus Apple case has left a sour taste,"The reported information on it is very scarce as to how they did it, it has in effect been classified it which means that we may never find out and is similar legal tool like the All Writs Act that was used by the FBI to push forward a demand for access in the earlier stages rather than resolve the paradox raised of how far the government can go in privacy and citizen rights and protection.   To some degree it has continued to reinforce the cyber war that is going on in all sides seeking to find ways to break secure systems, something that is no different to any other arms race for power.  The evidence is that cyber threats are a growing issue that was a core part of the Apple case for not opening up the phone and giving way to potentially more weaknesses. Industry cyber threat reports say this is growing at 66% annually in the PWC annual global state of information security survey 2015 , in financial theft this is over 90% annual growth.   The issue now is whether this has resolved anything other than created a scenario where , ""if we can get round your defense then that is ok"" appears to be what we now have again. The caveat is that this is for legal purposed to obtain data for anti-terrorism purposes. Companies will need to continue to address cyber security at a top priority as we live 24/7 and be able to keep most of what is normal privacy away from criminal activity.  The deeper question ""is our data safe and private?"" the former may be the case but our privacy seems to be increasingly harder to hold on to in the digital age and is something I forecast will become a bigger issue for all citizens as they try to control and value their privacy better. I see the FBI versus Apple case created a possible higher sense of the need for control over personal data and a rise in personal data systems will become ever more critical in the fight to regain access and control to your data whether for public or private means. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

12,John Garrity,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-garrity/a-blueprint-for-coordinat_b_9556250.html,A Blueprint for Coordination in the Global Connectivity Agenda,"As the benefits of Internet connectivity have come into full focus, a number of international organizations have announced programs for dramatically increasing the number of people connecting to the Internet. According to the United Nations' International Telecommunications Union (ITU), as of 2015 approximately 3.2 billion people were actively participating on the Internet, a dramatic increase from the 400 million people who were online just fifteen years prior at the turn of the century.   However, over half of the world's population currently does not access the Internet, nor benefit from the economic and educational opportunities afforded by connectivity. Attempts to tackle this challenge drive the range of global connectivity projects, including:  • The ITU's Connect 2020 Agenda, with four major targets including fostering the adoption of the Internet by 60% of the world population by 2020; • The US government's Global Connect program, with the goal of increasing Internet adoption by 1.5 billion people by 2020; • The World Economic Forum (WEF) program on the Internet for All surfacing replicable models to connect the next four billion people; • As well as several other campaigns and organizations such as the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI), the World Bank and their recent 2016 World Development Report, the UN Broadband Commission, the One campaign's Connect the World program and the various private sector initiatives to extend connectivity.   The good news is that global Internet adoption is still growing. Cisco's latest forecasts of Internet growth point to an increase of one billion more Internet users from 2014 to 2019. This is driven by current growth rates and the forecasts of market expansion by the main telecommunications operators. But there are two major limitations with relying solely on market mechanisms to expand the impact of the Internet:   1) The market will only go so far in extending Internet access. The so-called market possibilities frontier will not reach people for whom market access prices remain unaffordable or those in geographic regions where returns on commercial telecom  infrastructure investments are too low to incentivize build out; and  2) The positive growth and income effects of broadband and ICTs can act as a 'double edged sword' with regard to income gains: increasing income for segments of the populations that are intensively utilizing ICTs but driving income inequality as lower resourced segments of population remain excluded from growth-enhancing opportunities. Our own research highlights the role of ICTs in rising with-in country income inequality and we point to national programs to ensure low-resourced populations are included in digitization efforts.   These two limitations of market-only approaches call for the more comprehensive effort needed to ensure that all citizens get the same access to the economic and social benefits that are brought about by the Internet. Ensuring that global initiatives complement each other will help to reduce overlap and accelerate progress towards helping people get online and benefit from the Internet.     While over 2 billion current Internet users reside in developing countries, three broad challenges still prevent the vast majority of the world from adopting and benefiting from the Internet. The first is Internet availability.   The majority of Internet users today interact with the Internet via wireless, rather than wired connections. The ITU notes that wireless mobile broadband subscriptions have outnumbered fixed wired connections since 2009, and the growth rates of mobile broadband adoption are growing at a faster pace. While terrestrial and undersea optical fiber infrastructure links are connecting the world, the spread of low-cost smart devices indicates that the next billion Internet will connect to the Internet via wireless connections. This will be primarily via Wi-Fi (where an access point connects to a wired connection) and cellular wireless.   To date, over 95% of the world's population reside in areas where 2G mobile wireless data transmission is possible. However, greater data rich interactivity (images, videos, applications) requires higher bandwidth such as 3G connectivity, which covers over two thirds of the world's population. High-speed mobile broadband via 4G/LTE is increasingly spreading across the world as well, with over a billion subscriptions. While alternatives to backhaul technologies are available (such as satellite and other wireless connectivity modalities) access points will still predominately connect via Wi-Fi and cellular. The challenge for the global community is ensuring more infrastructure access so the remaining four billion people can connect, particularly for rural populations and those underserved by existing technologies.   While data connectivity already extends to the vast majority of the world's population, a second significant barrier to the adoption and use of the Internet is the sheer affordability of, or cost of access to, the Internet. Over 111 countries have achieved the global target set by the UN Broadband Commission for national prices to be below 5% of monthly Gross National Income (GNI). Two recent reports however, highlight how national income averages mask the true picture of affordability. A4AI's 2015/16 Affordability Report demonstrates how even in countries that have met the 5% price target, differences in income distribution leaves hundreds of millions of people priced out of affordable access. By segmenting national populations into quintiles (bottom to top 20% of the population), the report finds that even in the countries that have met the 5% target, nearly half a billion people, primarily women and the poor, cannot afford Internet access at that level. Facebook's State of Connectivity 2015: A Report on Global Internet Access takes a similar approach by comparing income distribution and mobile data prices globally. The authors find that introductory mobile broadband packages of 500MB (megabytes) are ""affordable for over 90% of people in developed countries, but only one third of those in developing markets."" The report also finds that average household expenditure on mobile Internet data services is more than double in developing countries (3.8% of household income per capita) than in developed countries (1.8%, on average).   When Internet access is available and affordable, the third critical barrier to adoption is accessibility and applicability. Do individuals have the skills and knowledge to be able to access the Internet, and do they find value in taking initiative to connect? In various surveys identifying the main reasons why some populations are not using the Internet, accessibility (in terms of the right skills) and applicability (in terms of relevance to their lives) are the top barriers. For example, an annual ICT survey conducted in Brazil by the Regional Center for Studies on the Development of the Information Society (CETIC) demonstrates that from 2007 to 2013, the two main reasons cited by non-Internet users for why they do not use the Internet are ""Lack of Internet Skills"" and ""Lack of Need or Interest"". While there is a generational difference in the survey responses, with younger non-users less likely to cite lack of interest (applicability), as the Michael Kende and Miguel Jimenez note, ""it is important to focus efforts on this persist minority of Brazilians who are not swayed by increased availability or lower costs."" This assertion can be extended to the rest of the 4+ billion people who are not currently online.   Tackling these challenges to accelerate Internet adoption will require a coordinated effort among public and private parties to ensure those who are not currently benefiting from the Internet are not further left behind. Expanding Internet availability requires extending network infrastructure with technology and effective business models, facilitated by conducive public policy. Ensuring affordable access requires competitive markets, creative new consumption models for underserved populations as well as policies that address commercial market failures. And addressing demand side issues of accessibility and applicability requires training programs, and the development of local content and applications benefiting users, among other actions.  The table presented above is a starting point for discussion on how various different actors in the global effort can play a role facilitating greater Internet connectivity. As the community coalesces this year in various fora discussing challenges and efforts, including the upcoming Global Connect Conference in Washington DC, mapping a coordinated effort of complementary activities can help ensure the various initiatives work together to achieve the shared goal of universal Internet adoption. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

13,Max Gladwell,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/max-gladwell/solomo-is-dead-long-live-_b_9470740.html,SoLoMo is Dead. Long Live Snapchat!,"As Snapchat goes mainstream, we simultaneously enter a new era in the smartphone revolution  That sound you've been hearing in the background but couldn't quite place it? It's the sound of Snapchat crossing the chasm. It's the siren song of the next big thing in media, entertainment, and communications. The early majority is showing up. Snapchat is going mainstream. Here's what you need to know if you're a brand, entrepreneur, or just over the age of 30.    What is Snapchat? Many know it as ""that sexting app."" This is how the mainstream media has portrayed it (scaring parents in the process) because Snapchat offers ephemeral messaging i.e. messages, photos, and videos that disappear. It's true this is how Snapchat started. It struck a chord at the right time with the right audience, enabling the app to quickly establish critical mass among innovators and early adopters. Disappearing messages was the killer feature. But Snapchat has evolved past this and now finds itself in a position to disrupt the entire media world.  Looking back, I see similarities with the ""social-local-mobile"" revolution of the past six or seven years, which was inconveniently labeled SoLoMo for short. Indeed, the mainstreaming of Snapchat really marks an end to this era and the start of a new one.    In 2011, just after closing the seed round for MomentFeed, I wrote The SoLoMo Manifesto, a tongue-in-cheek eBook about the unification of these trends and technologies. At the time, few agreed about how profound the change would be...that smartphones would go from the third to the first screen, that we'd rely on these devices for so much of our daily lives, that mobile was not a channel but a lifestyle, that consumer ""moments"" would be at the core of the smartphone experience, and that brands needed to take a holistic approach to mobile or risk irrelevance. By and large, this has all happened.  Facebook successfully pivoted to become a mobile company. Google's transition to mobile was cemented by Android, the Maps and YouTube apps, and its dominance of local search. And Instagram became the most important media brand to emerge from this era. Today, these are the only companies that really matter on mobile. They account for eight out of 10 of the top mobile apps in the world.  But Snapchat is on the rise.  A year before I wrote the manifesto, I penned a blog post about what it will mean to be ""smartphone native."" In 2010, modern smartphones had only been around for a few years. We were all immigrants to this technology. We used familiar frames like ""social, local, and mobile"" to understand and adapt to it. We learned to swipe. We marveled at location awareness, checking-in to places, and sharing contextual moments with friends. It was so new, and we were so young. But what about people who were born into the smartphone revolution, who didn't know a world without them? How would taking this for granted change the experience? Snapchat is a platform -- perhaps the first -- built for smartphone natives. Just as smartphones ushered in the post-PC era, Snapchat could be the start of a post-SoLoMo era.  In the SoLoMo era (2007 - 2016), we needed the technical designations. We needed to categorize what was social, local, and/or mobile. In the Snapchat era, though, it's all implied. It just is.  This is a Snapcode. Take a picture and use it to add someone. Give it a try!  Snapchat can only be accessed on mobile. It's a social app on a one-to-one or one-to-many basis. You can add Geo Filters to photos and videos based on your location and consume media from your local area in real time. And yet it's so much more. The whole is truly greater than the sum its parts, and it's most obvious in the user interface (UI).  If you want a beginner's guide to Snapchat, venture capitalist and prolific blogger Mark Suster wrote an excellent post for old folks (like me and probably you). He speculates about why the UI is the way it is: ""The starting screen every time is the camera. This is the dog whistle. It's the frequency designed to keep old people out and keep the product cool and hip for young people."" This is an old folks excuse. Snapchat's UI was not deliberately designed to keep old people out. It's a progression in mobile UI that non-smartphone natives just don't get. The best way to illustrate this is through the evolution of music.  Rock 'n' roll, punk rock, rap, new wave, EDM. These were not created to keep old people out. These ground-breaking musical genres represented artistic progress. Each drew inspiration from what came before, but they were entirely new and fresh, often fueled by new technology. Naturally, they appealed to people with open minds, who were predisposed to new things (what it means to be young). The oldies, naturally, have an allergic reaction to anything that alters or breaks their frame (what it means to be old). And this is what's happened with Snapchat. The oldies don't get it, but that's because they're too attached to the SoLoMo era of UI design.  The Snapchat UI is designed for smartphone natives. It opens to the camera. The navigation is entirely swipe based...swipe up, swipe down, swipe left or right. And there is a complete absence of menus and explanation. Smartphones are nothing if not intuitive, thanks to Steve Jobs, and Snapchat takes this to the extreme. Use it enough and you'll figure it out. In fact, the UI is having such an impact that it's being replicated in other apps.  TasteMade is one of the media companies with a channel in Snapchat's Discover area. It's a daily dose of snap-sized content for foodies, entirely programmed by TasteMade as if it was programming a TV network. So the company is uniquely familiar with the UI and how people use Snapchat. When TasteMade expanded into the travel vertical with an app called Facet, it validated how mainstream vertical video and the Snapchat UI is becoming.    If you're a brand, you should establish your Snapchat presence ASAP. The username land grab is already happening, so you may have to be flexible. Consider the medium and the audience, and start posting relevant Stories. If you're an entrepreneur, start thinking about the forthcoming Snapchat ecosystem. Many believe it's the next Facebook, so use that for historical reference.

While round-trips on the Concorde cost an average of $12,000 at the time, according to Air & Space, round trips from New York to London with Boom are projected to cost $5,000. “We are talking about the first supersonic jet people can afford to fly,” founder Blake Scholl told The Guardian.  The planes should be able to complete trips from San Francisco to Tokyo in 4.7 hours and L.A. to Sydney in 6 hours, Boom says on its website.  Virgin Galactic intends to help engineer, design and manufacture the supersonic Boom plane. The prototype is not operational yet and Boom is still seeking more funding, but the project is a promising step toward an era in which extra-speedy air travel could become the norm. Other concept jets like Skreemr, which could fly from London to NYC in just 30 minutes, have been proposed by engineers and inventors looking for the next leap forward.  Hey, a little healthy competition never hurt... right? -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

15,Daryl Deino,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daryl-deino/sennheiser-m2-wireless-he_b_9551786.html,Sennheiser M2 Wireless Headphones Are Best Bluetooth Cans Available," Photo by Daryl Deino  The Sennheiser M2 Wireless Over-the-Ear Headphones, even at $499, are not only the best Bluetooth headphones you can buy, they are also the best for the price. They offer a combination of sound and comfort that other Bluetooth headphones can't provide. Sennheiser is rapidly becoming a popular name for headphones, almost as popular as Bose or Beats by Dr. Dre. The M2 Wireless are actually better than any Bluetooth headphones from either of these companies.   The Sennheiser M2 Wireless were originally released in March of 2015 and most people who bought them had to return them because of a problem with the wireless signal fading in and out. Sennheiser recalled them and it took more than six months to put them back on the marketplace. The wait was certainly worth it.   The M2 Wireless have a folding design for portability and ear cups so soft that you feel no pressure whatsoever. You can work out with the M2 Wireless for two hours without feeling the need to take them off. Previous Sennheiser over-the-ear headphones had cups that were too small and somewhat uncomfortable. Sennheiser definitely listened to the feedback from customers and used it to create a perfectly designed headset.   More than any pair of headphones, The Sennheiser M2 Wireless need to be used for at least a couple hours before the sound reaches its full potential. For example, right out of the box, the bass didn't seem to have enough kick. But things changed later in the day. That said, the Over-the-Ear version still could use slightly more bass like the M2 Wireless On-Ear version, which some say has too much bass.   The middle and higher ranges of sound are spectacular for wireless and -- at times -- don't differentiate from the sound of some wired headphones. The M2 Wireless have AptX technology, which supposedly improves the sound quality with AptX-enabled devices such as Samsung's Galaxy S and Note series smartphones. However, the headphones sound better on the iPhone 6s, which doesn't have AptX, than the Galaxy Note 5 or Galaxy S6.   Then there is the noise cancellation, which is quite good -- almost as good as it is on the Bose QuietComfort 25 wired headphones. They are perfect for taking on a flight or even sleeping with, although you have to sleep with your head in a tilted position. Unlike other noise-cancellation headphones, the noise cancellation doesn't have any ""hiss"" or degrade the sound quality one single bit.  There are some audiophiles our there who say they would never buy wireless headphones because of the poor sound quality. While Bluetooth audio has its limits, Sennheiser does its best to overcome these limits and provides consumers with a fantastic product that costs a lot, but is worth every penny. The Sennheiser M2 Wireless headphones prove that Bluetooth audio is finally ready for prime time. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

OpenX is hoping to tidy up the multiple header partner playing field with its Meta solution, according to Qasim Saifee, the company's SVP, Monetization Platform. The main problem is that most solutions are on the client side, meaning a user's browser is sending signals to all header partners.  ""The more header partners you stuff inside your header, the heavier the page becomes,"" says Saifee. ""The more code you have on your page, the more likely it is there will be a challenge when it interacts with each other and that's going to lead to a problem with your page and your users.""  OpenX's Meta speeds up the ad call process by making it server-to-server.  ""Rather than have all partners called from user's page there is a single call from the user's browser to our meta solution,"" Saifee says. ""From our meta solution on our servers we are making lightening quick calls to every exchange partner, every marketplace that a publisher wants to use.""  The company is looking for mobile adoption of Meta as well.  ""Think about a user on a mobile device. Bandwidth is scarce and if you're calling multiple partners from the user's browser it will make pages heavy and slow,"" says Saifee.  Another target for Meta is video, which Saifee describes as ""ripe for header bidding solutions"" because in a scarce inventory environment publishers will be less inclined to work with marketplaces in the standard tag way.

17,Damon Beres,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/03/29/distracted-driving-smartphone_n_9564478.html,Sending A Text Behind The Wheel Is Like Driving Blindfolded Across A Football Field," If you look at your phone for just four seconds when you're behind the wheel, it's like driving the equivalent of more than 100 yards while blindfolded. That's essentially the length of a football field. Gary Lowry, an insurance manager at the American Automobile Association, cited the number -- which has been floated before -- in an interview Monday with Local 24 News in Memphis, Tennessee.  ""If you're driving 55 [miles per hour] and you're texting and driving, the average text takes four seconds -- that's equivalent of driving 125 yards blindfolded,"" Lowry said. The actual number from that math is a bit lower -- more like 108 yards -- but that's splitting hairs. There is absolutely no question that your smartphone is a major safety threat if you use it in your car, not just for you as a driver but anyone else near you on the road. One-third of drivers admitted to texting while driving in a recent survey, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that at least eight people are killed in a distracted driving-related accident every day in the U.S. There's one really clear solution here: Do not use your phone when you are driving, period.

According to Meredith Hall, GM Learning and Development at The Trade Desk, it's critical for modern markers to evolve from being siloed specialists to becoming generalists so they can understand the full strategy of a media plan. Having all players share common definitions of programmatic parlance is key to this broadening.  ""I think it's really important to kind of hit rewind and make sure that everyone actually understands what programmatic is,"" Hall says in an interview at the annual Transformation conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. ""We've been working in this business for the past seven years and I still find myself being asked by people 'What is programmatic?'  The Trade Desk's online curriculum is branded The Trading Academy, a module-based offering whose ultimate output is certification for the company's agency clients and others. The 100 series walks participants through the process of ""understanding the landscape, dissecting the Lumascape and understanding what happens in 100 milliseconds,"" Hall explains. The 200 series gets into such subjects as data collection and pixel placement and leads to a mid-term exam, followed by the 300 series covering the forward market and other advanced topics.

19,Erin Schumaker,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/03/29/telemedicine-could-expand-access-to-medical-abortions_n_9564400.html,The Tech Innovation That Might Make It Easier For Women Everywhere To Get Abortions," (Reuters Health) - Women in the U.S. without reproductive health services close to home might have an easier time getting medical abortions if they could consult with doctors online instead of scheduling in-person visits, some providers argue. Although surgical abortions require clinic visits, roughly one quarter of abortions are done with medication and might be provided with telemedicine – using webcams and video chats to diagnose and treat these patients, Dr. Elizabeth Raymond of Gynuity Health Projects in New York and colleagues argue in JAMA Internal Medicine. “The use of telemedicine is growing,” Raymond said by email. “It has tremendous potential to make many essential services more accessible, more convenient and cheaper. Medical abortion is such a service.” For many U.S. women, obtaining an abortion is difficult because they live at least 100 miles away from the nearest clinic, the authors note. Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota and North Dakota each only have one abortion clinic, and Wyoming has none. Medical abortions performed before 10 weeks of gestation with two drugs – mifepristone and misoprostol – can be self-administered at home. Healthcare providers can use telemedicine to interview patients and assess potential safety issues by reviewing lab test results and ultrasounds before prescribing medication, the authors note. In the two-step medical abortion regimen typically used in the U.S., women first take mifepristone. This pill works by blocking the hormone progesterone, which causes the lining of the uterus to break down and makes it impossible for the pregnancy to continue. Then, 24 to 48 hours later, women take misoprostol, which causes the uterus to empty. Women are usually advised to have a clinic visit within two weeks to confirm the pregnancy was terminated. In rare cases when ultrasound or a blood test shows the medical abortion didn’t succeed, women require surgical abortions. In 2008, a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Iowa initiated the first formal telemedicine abortion program in the U.S. with physicians reviewing labs and imaging then speaking to patients to determine if the clinic should be authorized to dispense medical abortion pills. In the first year, this program nearly tripled the number of sites in Iowa offering abortion services, from six to 17, the researchers report. Among 233 women with follow-up, the treatment was successful 99 percent of the time. One patient had a blood transfusion in an emergency department, and there were no other serious adverse events reported. Direct-to-patient telemedicine programs for medical abortions are available in the Canadian province of British Columbia and in Australia, the authors note. But in the U.S., regulators require that abortion medications be dispensed to patients in clinics, medical offices and hospitals. Widespread use of telemedicine for medical abortions in the U.S. is also restricted because some states require in-person exams or have banned telemedicine abortions, the authors note. “Currently, more than half of rural women don’t have access to reproductive health services anywhere in their county,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a researcher in health policy at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in Minneapolis who wasn’t involved in the study. “For these women, telemedicine can make medication abortions more accessible,” Kozhimannil added by email. “Non-clinical factors, including state and federal regulations, influence requirements such as exams and in-person clinician visits,” Kozhimannil said. “Many of these decisions are influenced by political factors, and not explicitly made based on medical evidence.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/22Iat5T JAMA Internal Medicine, online March 28, 2016. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.
