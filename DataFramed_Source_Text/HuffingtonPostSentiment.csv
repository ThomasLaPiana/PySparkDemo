They're sorting your packages, deciding what you see on Facebook and might be coming for your job.   But have you ever wondered where the word ""robot"" comes from?  It traces its roots to the Czech word ""robotnik, which means ""slave,"" according to the Online Etymology Dictionary. ""Robotnik"" comes from ""rabota,"" the Old Church Slavonic word for servitude.  In English, the word ""robot"" first appeared in a translation of Czech playwright Karel Capek's 1920 sci-fi drama ""RUR,"" or ""Rossum's Universal Robots."" In his play, Capek describes a company that manufactures and sells workers that look and act like humans, but lack souls.  ""The Robots are not people. Mechanically they are more perfect than we are, they have an enormously developed intelligence, but they have no soul,"" says the play's human protagonist, Harry Domin. (His surname, it's worth noting, is also a Latin prefix meaning ""master.""). In Capek's story, the intelligent servants rebel against their human masters. It's a tale that's been echoed again and again as artists and writers grapple with rapid technological change. Books and films like ""Frankenstein,"" ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,"" ""i, Robot"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" all depict mechanical beings struggling to throw off the yoke of human mastery. These books and films express the deep, nagging human fear that our uniqueness, and our dominance, will be threatened by our own creations.  We fear, in other words, the battle cry of the robot Radius in Capek's play: ""You will work! You will build for us! You will serve us!"" -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

1,Andrew Hart,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/04/08/us-apple-iphone-new-york_n_9648002.html,U.S. To Keep Fighting For Apple To Unlock iPhone In New York Drug Case,"   By Julia Love, Joseph Menn and Nate Raymond (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday said it would keep fighting to force Apple Inc to open an iPhone in a New York drug case, continuing its controversial effort to require Apple and other tech companies to help law enforcement authorities circumvent encryption. Just two weeks ago, the government dropped its effort to require Apple to crack an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the December attacks in San Bernardino, California, saying it had unlocked the phone without Apple's help. Some observers thought the government would back away from the New York case too, since the suspect has already pleaded guilty. But in a letter filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the Justice Department said, ""The government continues to require Apple's assistance in accessing the data that it is authorized to search by warrant."" An Apple attorney said Friday the company was disappointed but not surprised that the government would continue to fight in New York after giving up in California. He said the appeal belied the FBI's claim that the San Bernardino case was about a single phone and the need to stop future terror acts. Apple, with the strong support of most of the technology industry, argues that requiring it to circumvent the encryption in its own products would inevitability open the door for hackers and foreign spies and undermine security for everyone. The company has said it is willing to take the issue to the Supreme Court. The phones in the two cases have different security features, with the New York phone running an earlier version of the iPhone operating software. The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey, who is leading the battle against Apple, said Thursday that the method used on the San Bernardino phone would not work on other models. But the New York phone is much easier for Apple to break into. Apple has acknowledged it could get data from the drug dealer's phone without crafting special software, as it would have had to do with the San Bernardino phone. Apple helped law enforcement with earlier iPhones on some 70 occasions, according to court documents, and it objected to the order in the New York case only after it was invited to do so last fall by U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein. Since then, Apple has declined to comply with such orders without a fight, a person close to the company said. In a case that came to light Friday, a Boston judge had ordered Apple to cooperate in a gang case. Apple also objected there, and the Justice Department said it has not yet decided whether to push again to force its assistance. In a ruling issued on Feb. 29, Orenstein came down firmly on Apple's side, rejecting the idea that an old law known as the All Writs Act gave judges the power to order Apple's help. That judge, Apple and the FBI have all said the balance between encryption and law enforcement access should be struck by Congress, and one such proposal is nearing formal introduction by the leaders of the Senate intelligence committee. The Justice Department announcement Friday, however, showed it will continue to fight in the courts as well. Jill Bronfman, director of the Privacy and Technology Project at University of California Hastings College of the Law, questioned whether the facts involved in the New York case would make a strong test case over encryption. While extracting data from the phone in the New York case would be an easier technical feat for Apple, the facts in the case are far less compelling, she said. “If you want to do a balancing test and you’ve got terrorism on one side of the scale, that’s a very heavy weight,” she said. “We’ll see how the request is balanced when we have drugs on the other side.” Apple is scheduled to file papers in opposition of the Justice Department's appeal by April 15. In its appeal, the Apple lawyer said the company would try the same thing it was planning in California: demanding that government show it had tried all possible alternative means of getting into the phone. That could force the FBI to reveal closely held details of its efforts to break into phones. Federal law enforcement officials declined to say whether they were looking into having third parties unlock the phone in the New York case. The phone in the Brooklyn case belonged to Jun Feng, who has pleaded guilty to participation in a methamphetamine distribution conspiracy. The Justice Department is seeking to unlock Feng's phone to find other conspirators.

2,Nathan Gardels,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-gardels/weekend-roundup-112_b_9642186.html,Weekend Roundup: Tax Havens and Refugee Camps Describe Today's World,"This week, two faces of globalization -- tax havens and refugee camps -- were dramatically on display. As the ""Panama Papers"" revealed, the super-rich and well-connected have been sending boatloads of money offshore to hide their wealth and escape taxation. Powerless and penniless refugees who risked their lives on rickety vessels to reach Europe's safe shores were being sent back from camps in Greece to an uncertain fate amid the violence, misery and insecurity of the regions from which they had escaped.  Along with a consortium of other global media, The WorldPost this week has been following the continuing revelations in documents leaked from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca. World Reporter Nick Robins-Early tells us what we need to know about the Panama Papers, which have so far implicated a wide array of figures from the families of Chinese Politburo members and British Prime Minister David Cameron to cronies of Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko.  Taking the spotlight this week though was the prime minister of Iceland, who stepped aside following the leaks. In our ""Forgotten Fact,"" we look at why the Panama Papers hit a nerve in Iceland. World Reporter Charlotte Alfred also examines how Rami Makhlouf, Syria's richest man and a close associate and cousin of Syrian President Bashar Assad, hid his ill-gotten gains through what appeared to be ""shell"" companies registered in the British Virgin Islands.   This week the European Union began to implement a new plan to block the route of illegal migration to Europe by sending refugees and migrants on the Greek islands back to Turkey. Danae Leivada reports from Athens that the new refugee arrivals in the 24 hours before the deportations began surpassed the number of those being expelled. Writing from Copenhagen, Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen and Helle Malmvig explain how Denmark, once the most welcoming country for refugees, has become an ""ugly duckling"" that is among the most resistant. In a global video discussion, Harvard philosopher Michael Sandel convenes participants from over 30 countries to debate the ethics of asylum and immigration policies. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that ""refugees have a right to asylum, not bias and barbed wire"" and that the international community must join together to address the root causes of war and radicalization.   Writing from Amman, Jordan, Daoud Kuttab explains how Jordanian authorities are doing a good job handling terrorism through sophisticated intelligence and close knowledge of the community. Writing from Kochi, India, Chandran Nair describes how religions coexist and gender quality is the norm in ""God's Own Country"" of Kerala. Dilip Hiro fears that the India-Pakistan border in Kashmir is ""the most dangerous place on Earth"" as tensions rise between the two nuclear-armed powers. Chen Kai, who heads the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, lauds the commitments made at President Obama's Nuclear Security Summit last week and says China will play ""an active role in establishing, constructing and upholding this international nuclear security architecture."" Former National Security Adviser Ra Jong-Yil writes from Seoul that China's effort to improve ties with South Korea is more about splitting it off from the American-led alliance in Northeast Asia than protecting it from North Korea. Physicist Frank von Hippel and Fumihiko Yoshida worry that, ""Today, a number of countries -- including France and Japan -- are separating plutonium from the spent fuel of their reactors and building dangerous stockpiles of this weapon-usable nuclear material with no good economic purpose.""   Writing about the drift from illiberal democracy to autocracy, Yascha Mounk argues leaders such as Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan or Hungary's Viktor Orban are, ""disdainful of liberal norms and convinced of their unique ability to channel the views of ordinary people even when they are headed for defeat at the ballot box."" Thus, Mounk continues, ""they blame all political opposition on traitors at home or abroad and undermine free and fair elections. Voted in as the champions of the people, they slowly and unwittingly start to turn the illiberal democracies they have created into straightforward autocracies."" Mihir Sharma writes that, ""the autocrats seek to restore a national pride somehow lost in the age of globalization."" WorldPost Middle East Correspondent Sophia Jones reports from Istanbul on how American and Iraqi comedians are teaming up to lighten the souls of those living in the war-torn country.   In an interview, world-renowned pianist Stephen Hough says, ""the Internet tempts us to think that because an email or a new website can be accessed in seconds that everything works at the same instant speed. Art is more like the growth of a plant. It needs time and space.""   Fusion takes a troubling look at the influence of a Colombian hacker who claims to have influenced the outcome of elections, including for the Mexican presidency. ""When I realized that people believe what the Internet says more than reality, I discovered that I had the power to make people believe almost anything,"" he said in a recent interview. Claire van den Heever examines Uber's unrelenting challenge to its deep-pocketed rivals in China. This heartbreaking video shows a campaign in China to destigmatize so-called ""leftover women"" who are shamed for being single.  Our Singularity series this week focuses on how technology can help solve the looming global water crisis, including by engineering biology to clear our water and making the oceans drinkable. From Cape Town, filmmaker Sven Harding looks at how the city's forgotten underground tunnels could help it tackle its drought problem. It's spring, and the cherry blossoms are bursting out in Japan.

4,George Zarkadakis,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-zarkadakis/the-worm-the-robot-and-th_b_9640660.html,"The worm, the robot, and the cave of shadows","What if we could download our minds in a computer and lived forever as pure, digital consciousness? What if we are already living inside a computer simulation created by a technologically advanced alien civilization - which it too is a simulation created by yet another alien civilization, and so on to infinity? The computer revolution has reframed some age-old questions about reality and, more to the point, our perception to reality. Add genetics to the mix of technologies and you get to an interesting watershed in human history, where we could potentially test the hypothesis of the Matrix movies: can we, do we, exist outside our bodies?  Such questions take for granted an assumption that the ""mind"" is a product of the brain. Although the brain is a physical object it has a certain organisation, neurons and neural networks made up of interconnected neurons. This complex organisation pattern is called the ""connectome"". We can describe the connectome using information, in other words we can encode the connectome into a software-based description that can be uploaded in a computer and simulated. Indeed the ""Human Brain Project"" aims to do exactly that: to build the infrastructure that will allow for the ""human connectome"" to be coded and uploaded on a vast farm of computer servers. It's a huge scientific ambition and an enormous undertaking, which promises to provide a computer-based testbed for experimenting with new drugs and to better understanding brain disease. But let us not kid ourselves: what is really at stake here is whether that simulated brain will exhibit the kind of behaviour we associate with real, body and all, humans. Will the simulated brain in Switzerland, where the Human Brain Project is based, have consciousness? Will it have an ""I""?  So far, scientists have managed to decode the connectome of humble C. Elegans, a hapless worm with a mere 302 neurons compared to the 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion connections of the human brain. An experiment whereby the worm's ""mind"" was uploaded to a tiny robot has shown some tantalizing results. Each time the robot knocked its ""head"" it coiled backwards, just like the real thing. Is there a ""real worm"" inside the robot? And how can we know?  It is exactly the latter question that usually causes the whole grand edifice of digital immortality and consciousness upload to fail. The big idea that what we perceive is not real and that all is pure mind was articulated by Plato in the 5th century BC. He described humanity living in chains inside a cave, and able to seeing only shadows on the walls of the cave that we mistake for reality. Plato suggested that only by ""awakening"" could someone discover the truth, and break free of the illusionary cave. Plato's ideas have informed much of Christian theology. In our secular, post-religion world, his ideas met with the dematerialization of information in the age of computing and mutated. We do not speak of soul, or heaven, or afterlife anymore. But we do speak of essentially similar things by using more ""scientific"" terms: connectome, simulation, upload. Just as in the various rationalist critiques of Plato or of the early Church fathers, the unanswerable question in the experience of ""awakening"" is that we must trust in the word of the ""awakened"". There is no objective way of verifying someone else's subjective experience. We do not expect the C. Elegans to let us know how it feels inside the mechanical body of the robot. But if there comes the day when the brain simulation in Switzerland is complete, and ""awakens"": should we believe what it will say? Will its mind be as ""real"" as our own? Or will it be an illusion, a mere projection of our own minds, and wishful thinking, on the digital walls of a computer server farm? -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

I thought he was superman in disguise as my dad and often referred to him as a ""computer genius."" Genius was the key word.   I scored far higher on my math SATs than my verbal SATs but always thought of myself as a creative and humanities type of student. I could never be a ""computer genius"" like my dad. When I placed into an honors math class my freshman year of college, I thought that there was no place for me in the class as an intended performance arts and journalism major.   Some - or many - years have passed and I am one week into learning to code. With technology as a professional and personal lifeline, I feel an obligation to learn.   These are the top ten ways I rely on technology day-in and day-out:  My cell phone alarm clock Facetime to call my ""computer genius"" dad on the opposite coast Duolingo to learn Spanish Keeping up with friends on Instagram/Facebook/Twitter/Snapchat Watching all of the things on Netflix Getting around on Lyft Listening to all of my favorite artists on Spotify and iTunes (Taylor Swift) Working for Girls Who Code from anywhere with my Gmail app Walking from point A to point B with Google maps Paying my credit card bill   and many many more...  I've not yet become completely reliant on Siri but I anticipate her playing a larger role in my life in the coming years. As much as I try to cut technology out of my life, the reality is that it's not going anywhere and I need it to function on a daily basis.   So, back to learning to code...  As I start my journey into learning to code, the image of my father as the ""computer genius,"" is at the forefront of my mind. Of course my father is a genius in my opinion, but do you need to be an actual genius to learn to code?  The answer is no.   All you need is a willingness to try and a good sense of humor.   In my first ""Intro to Javascript"" lesson, I created the snowman below.    It's beautiful, right?   Okay, so it's not that beautiful but I created it just by typing 15 lines of letters and numbers, known as code. These lines all are very specific directions for the computer. It's like giving the computer a recipe to make, but this recipe has no shopping or clean-up involved. While it doesn't result in food, it does result in an image that you can share with you family and friends.     Creating this not-so-beautiful snowman with code was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I felt smart, capable and challenged. I can't wait for my next lesson and to one day have the ability to create something that will make my daily life easier.

On Friday, SpaceX successfully delivered a cargo ship, carrying an experimental, balloon-like habitat, to the International Space Station and pulled off a nearly impossible at-sea landing of its rocket booster. ""Fifth time's a charm!"" a SpaceX webcast commentator said, as cheers erupted at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California.  (Story continues below.)

During a post-launch press conference, Musk said the successful landing is a ""milestone"" in the future of space flight and an exciting day for his team of 5,000 people at SpaceX. What set Friday's launch apart, he said, was that ""the rocket landed instead of putting a hole in the ship, or tipping over,"" drawing laughter from those in attendance. Musk added it's likely the returned booster will be relaunched within a few months, following a series of test fires on the ground. In the future, he said, the hope is that reusing a rocket booster will require little more than giving it a wash and adding propellant. Friday's launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, is SpaceX's first cargo resupply mission to the space station since one of its Falcon 9 rockets, carrying 4,000 pounds in research equipment, exploded shortly after liftoff in June. (SpaceX has had recent successes deploying satellites into orbit, however.) Onboard the Dragon spaceship currently en route to ISS are 7,000 pounds of supplies and payloads. Among the most anticipated is the 3,100-pound Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or BEAM, an ""experimental expandable capsule"" that NASA says could one day be used as habitable structures by space crews traveling to the moon, Mars or other destinations.

While SpaceX's at-sea landings remain experimental, they've become the anticipated highlight of each mission. In the wake of last month's crash, Musk hinted that Friday's go-around might be the winner.  Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 5, 2016   In December, SpaceX made history when a Falcon 9 landed successfully on land about 6 miles away from where it took off. Musk called it a “revolutionary“ moment and a “critical step along the way to being able to establish a city on Mars.” By developing rockets that can be reused, SpaceX ultimately hopes to make space flight cheaper and easier. While it costs between $200,000 to $300,000 to refill the rocket, the rocket itself costs $60 million, Musk said during Friday's press conference. Musk said the eventual goal is for such landings not to draw such interest. ""We’ll be successful, ironically, when it becomes boring,"" Musk said. The space community came out in force Friday to congratulate SpaceX on its successful launch and landing. President Barack Obama chimed in with a word of congratulations too.

7,Himanshu Sareen,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/himanshu-sareen/four-ways-a-peertopeer-pl_b_9643292.html,Four Ways A Peer-to-Peer Platform Can Boost Your Nonprofit's Fundraising Efforts,"Crowdsourcing, kickstarting, online team or personal fundraising.   No matter what terminology you employ, peer-to-peer (P2P) fundraising matches donors to borrowers in an online setting to raise money for a common goal. According to the Peer to Peer Forum, contributions to the 30 largest peer-to-peer fundraising programs in the U.S. totaled $1.57 billion in 2015, up 9.8 percent over the amount raised by the 30 largest programs in 2006.  People love to come together for a good cause, particularly if it includes some element of interaction where they can actively participate.   That's why initiatives like the ALS ice bucket challenge are whopping successes. More than 17 million people uploaded videos where they doused themselves in ice-cold water. In the process, they raised more than $115 million for the national ALS Association toward a cure for the devastating disease with an additional $13 million poured into regional ALS branches.   And ... it was just plain fun.   If you run a nonprofit, you work tirelessly to invent solutions that will continue to engage existing donors while luring in new donations. Since your time and funds are at a premium, it makes good business sense to adopt a P2P platform that can boost your nonprofit's fundraising efforts by allowing you to automate some of the processes for which you lack the manpower, while freeing up time for you to focus your efforts on other endeavors. Maybe those endeavors don't involve a bucket, ice water, and a video camera. Think a 5K fun run. A chili cook-off contest. Or a pub crawl.   By using a P2P platform, you can leverage the power of potential and existing donors to create a successful network or fundraising. With that in mind, I present four ways to boost your fundraising efforts by using a P2P platform. There are a number of out-of-the-box P2P solutions available, but keep in mind that many companies can also customize a P2P platform for your nonprofit.    You can actively engage with your existing supporters      Donors are the nonprofit's lifeblood. You rely on them for monetary support and to spread the word to potential supporters. They are your first line of public relations, and you must retain those loyal donors to help acquire new support.   Using a P2P platform allows your nonprofit to more easily post information on social media channels, to answer questions and engage with those existing audiences, and to inspire them to ask other donors to give to your cause. P2P site Razoo found that every Facebook share helps raise about $18 of donations on its site.  Make your existing supporters feel valued. Most P2P sites have the ability to send out event reminders, personalized donor thank you notes, newsletters, and rewards. Aid Afghanistan for Education and Peace's IndieGoGo campaign, for instance, offered donor rewards of notes, photos, or calendars from the Afghan students ... and the initiative raised more than $11,000 from 75 backers in one month.    You can track your data     Who are you reaching through your P2P platform? Many P2P platform solutions provide basic in-software management interfaces. They may include full access to a donor's information, the ability to sort donation data and key in offline donations (cash or check) to the site, and you may have the power to edit and modify individual's fundraising pages, and view their aggregate progress.   You can further track the success of your efforts or a specific campaign by harnessing the power of third-party analytics tools, like Google Analytics, Flurry, Facebook Insights, or Buffer. Which posts on your website resonated enough with audiences to motivate them to donate? Which email newsletters resulted in monetary support? Which Facebook pages received the most traction?   Tracking both engagement and campaign progress by using both P2P and outside analytics software allow you to understand how effective your nonprofit raises money--all while allowing you to better tailor the way you fundraise.    You can make brand awareness fun     We run for cancer, walk for Parkinson's, and gather to remember those taken by suicide. Not particularly scintillating topics, but a little outside-the-box thinking can motivate people to participate. In a tongue-in-cheek move, Birmingham, Alabama, holds an annual ""Rumpshaker Run"" for colorectal cancer. And Parkinson's groups across the nation offer Movers and Shakers events.   Think fun, upbeat! A color run. A polar bear plunge. An auction. A walk. All these types of lighthearted events empower people to volunteer, to reach out, to give time and money to a serious cause.   Remember St. Jude's Mathathon? It was the original, pre-Internet successful crowdfunding. The 35-year-old school charity enables parents and family to donate a certain amount of money per math problem completed by a school-age child. Since 1979, the program has raised $450 million toward finding a cure for childhood cancer.   When you give donors a cause that excites them, they can also go out and create individual fundraising pages using your P2P platform. By creating a personal fundraising page that links to your nonprofit, friends, family, and other backers can make donations to your charitable organization through those individuals.    You can get paid more quickly    MobileCause, a cloud-based fundraising platform, reports that 28 percent of those who donate to a non-profit cause are likely to donate again, and 71% of Millennials report fundraising for a nonprofit. The site also found that crowdfunding creates ""a sense of urgency for a specific project.""   And using a P2P platform is a quick and easy way to get money. Most P2P platforms accept a variety of payment forms--from major credit cards to PayPal or Apple Pay. And once the platform has the donor's payment information, it can send donation reminders at later dates.   Keep in mind that most crowdfunding platforms charge at least a nominal baseline fee and processing costs. But the relatively small cost may well be worth your time and effort. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

8,Charles Edge,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-edge/from-dungeon-master-to-sc_1_b_9643530.html,From Dungeon Master to Scrum Master: 15 Software Development Lessons from Dungeons and Dragons,"I started playing Dungeons and Dragons in about the 5th or 6th grade. I didn't get good at it for a while, but once I did, I didn't play much longer (insert reference to ""The Best Days of My Life"" here.) Dungeons and Dragons taught me a few lessons that I didn't realize would turn out to be great life lessons, until I was much older. This childhood game taught me life lessons that I would eventually apply to the business world - more specifically, the world of software development - and I know I'm not alone. In fact, there is a distinct possibility that many a developer got their start scoping out character sheets, and many a Scrum Master began as a Dungeon Master.  Here are a few of the lessons I took away from those carefree days. And yes, this image is from a box set sitting on my table at home. Don't judge.     1. Build a great campaign, and if the game is good, expect your players to break it.   In software, we design workflows. Then, users take routes we never thought possible. You build a product, sell the product and potentially service the product long-term. Maybe it sells, maybe it doesn't - but if you're not ready for the sales to happen, you won't sell that much. How much work do you put into building a campaign, or game, in Dungeons and Dragons, if the characters are just going to go right off your script? How much effort do you put into building a business if the customers are just going to buy something from you that is completely different than what you thought you were going to sell? These are the same questions, and there's no right answer to either (although there are many wrong answers). Understand that when momentum strikes, if you don't have a good campaign built that is flexible, you won't maintain that momentum. And if you haven't thought of all the various routes a user can take around your software, you're going to have a bunch of lost paladins mucking around in swamps with no monsters!  2. If you have to stop the game to look up the rules, your momentum is lost.  Games are always more fun when we understand the rules. When you have to stop and look something up, the attention of gamers can get lost on distractions - like potato chips. Similarly, the attention of someone using your software is lost when they encounter an exception or error, and have to wait for a patch while you reengineer the whole product. The more resilient your software, the more likely users will ramp up their use of the product quickly, and not have their attention wander when you have to look up how to properly figure out what saving throw is required to keep from getting crispy from the breath of a red dragon.  3. Engage your users.  There's not much reason to play Dungeons and Dragons alone. If the game isn't fun, you will invariably not have many people come back for a second or third campaign. People who use your software need to be engaged. Products and companies these days need to have a personality. Sure, you might make a great widget, but if it isn't fun to come to work and even make, sell or support that widget, then you're going to have a much harder time getting those things done. Fun brands and software, just like fun games, drive engagement - and engagement is one of the easiest ways to amplify your development efforts.  4. You gain experience incrementally, but it shows in bursts.  In Dungeons and Dragons, you gain experience points for doing things. When you accumulate enough experience, you go up a level. In development, we slowly work our way towards a new level. We learn lessons along the way (like how a Level 1 Cleric learns not to tackle a blue dragon alone). I was recently in a meeting where someone said our software development organization had reached a whole new level (and given that we recently doubled the staff of our development teams, it really has). In development, you work your way to a new level, learning lessons, training staff, expanding, paying down tech debt, etc. But all of a sudden, you realize ""Holy crap, we can now cast fireball spells!"" When did that happen? Sometimes you don't even know - but it's usually obvious to everyone that a gap was closed, a threshold crossed and it's time to start building momentum for the next level, tackling more difficult monsters, arming up with better weapons and maybe even picking up some new NPCs along the way! Can you say it's time to ship a major release?!  5. To sell, you need to be confident.  When it's your turn in a game, you may talk as your character would (I've heard some of the worst, yet most endearing accents ever in these games.) The more confident you are, the more immersive the game. Without confidence, a Dungeon Master is likely to get walked all over. Most jobs in a company have way more of a sales component that most employees would like to admit. Product management, software architects, and development managers are the obvious Dungeon Masters, but every developer is going to have areas where they want to do more (paying down tech debt vs. building a new feature being a common one) - and selling that to the team is half the battle!  6. Some players are just going to be more engaged than others, no matter what you do.   Different people want different things out of a game of Dungeons and Dragons, their jobs and life in general. When I was taking MBA classes at Cornell, they referred to this as different people having their own motivators. These motivators influence how impactful various initiatives are. For example, some respond well to financial incentives. Others, to social interactions or pats on the back. Some players have a math test the next day and are going to miss a game. Others are ridiculously into the game (common with developers). Just because you put a lot of work into developing a campaign or a new button in a product, that doesn't mean that others are going to be into each and every game. Everyone will have more fun if the expectations for engagement with a given initiative are tempered and any involvement is looked at positively.  7. Don't dominate the game.  Everyone should have a say in how games go. There are going to be natural alphas in any group - but try to give everyone ample time to play and talk about what their character is doing. If some people don't have that much to say, that's fine. Just routinely return to them and give them the opportunity. This is how any game, meeting, brainstorming session or retrospective can be run. If one player is dominating the game, it's a great idea to step in and keep them from doing so. How you go about doing so will become a skill that you hone for decades. And, try not to be that person who dominates.   8. You are invariably going to outgrow the game.  People don't stay in the same position forever. You need to build a growth path. Likewise, you don't want your level 5 Drow Elf Ranger to stay level 5 forever. You want to be prepared for how the game will play out with higher level characters, and maybe even keep a funnel of lower level characters and employees who can work their way up into higher positions. And when a player decides to leave the game, you need a succession plan. This is easier in Dungeons and Dragons than in a development team. Sure, you can switch classes, just like employees can switch departments, but it's a pretty linear path for most in the game. In the real world, everyone will have something different they want out of a job and it's the job of a servant leader to help them get there, even if that means helping them soar to new heights at another organization. Of course, it's best if you can provide a growth plan that keeps your awesome people in house - but sometimes a player is going to go off to college. Maybe they'll come over and take over as the Dungeon Master when they come home though, so stay in touch.  9. Morale is optional in Dungeons and Dragons, but not in a development team.  Morale was a slightly more advanced feature for Dungeon Masters. If a creature or retainer fails morale check, it will disengage from a battle and retreat. If it sucks to work at your company or on your team, the team will do the same (Maybe they'll spend more time catching up on Clash of Clans than finishing that Hibernate implementation.) If you don't work on morale, you won't find yourself with talented developers for long. After all, developers can find a new job faster than you can take out a kobold with a pair of Drizzt Vorpal Scimitars, +4.  10. It's about the journey, not the destination.  Sure, you could rush through a dungeon or a forest of kobolds in record time. But why? Killing all the kobolds is going to get you experience points, which add up until you get to the point where you can tackle golems and orcs and dragons. When writing code, we must be thorough. I find that I can get 90 percent of a project done in no time. That last 10 percent is the hardest - but also where I learn the most. It's also where others can see the polish. You obviously need to complete projects, but it's the journey towards all of your goals and the learning process that really matter. If you're rushing through everything, it will show. Plus, there's usually a low chance you'll get some kind of magic item off a kobold.  11. Eventually, your fighter has to work on more traits than just strength.  The easiest character to play is usually a fighter, because you're just a ""tank"". You can walk into a room and fight and kill monsters. In Dungeons and Dragons, each character has a number of different abilities - things like dexterity, which helps a thief to pick locks and helps characters to avoid getting hit. There's also intelligence, wisdom, constitution, charisma and strength. Each class of character will need different abilities to be higher than others. As you level up, you receive adjustments you can add to abilities. Naturally, a player will work on the abilities for their class first. For example, if you have a fighter, you'll increase strength and constitution (which gives you more hit points), or if you have a thief you'll work on dexterity. But as the character progresses, you'll invariably work on different abilities to unlock more advanced features of your class. The same is true at work. Let's say you write code for a living, which many consider the magic-user of the business world these days. Eventually, you may choose to manage a team, become a Scrum Master or manage products. For each of these, it will greatly help if you've dedicated a little time to working on your charisma ability. So while public speaking and management classes might not seem all that awesome for a code monkey, they will suit you well later in the game of your career.  12. The more junk you have, the slower you move.  Each item that your character finds in the game will weigh you down a little. Eventually, you'll have to choose what to carry and what to leave behind. And sometimes, you'll find yourself leaving behind things that you fought huge battles with monsters to attain. It's hard to let go of things, but sometimes you have to. At work, you might have projects that you want to continue but have to let them go to move into a new position, or you might have equipment that you love but can't keep. You might have data on your computer or mobile device that's just wasting space, or you might have variables that are hogging up valuable memory. Keep in mind that there's a weight to that data. Learn to let things go. Sometimes the character simply can't move to the next room with a massive bag of treasure on their back.  13. Diversity is key.  A party of six fighters really isn't going to make it far. Nor six clerics. You need a couple of fighters, a cleric (to heal everyone), a magic user (maybe an elf), a thief (likely a halfling), and more. A well-rounded adventuring party is key to the success of a campaign. The same is true for development teams. Different experiences and different backgrounds bring different ideas and perspectives - and also bring everyone's game up a notch. Of course, sometimes your half-orc rogue will spar with your paladin, but the team is better for having everyone together.  14. Sometimes you have to retreat.   A 4th level barbarian walks into a bar... It sounds like a joke, until it ends with ""and gets shot with lightning by a level 36 drow lich-king"". Have an open mind. Be creative, but if your initiatives aren't working out, get out of the bar, before you get lit up. Having said that, let things play out. Sometimes the lich-king just hits you with a riddle and might give you treasure rather than have you dual it out. Software development should be about trying new things. Be prepared to change course and don't be afraid to admit that you were wrong.  15. Sometimes you get a critical miss. Sometimes you get a critical hit.   In Dungeons and Dragons, if you're trying to stab a monster, you roll the dice to see if you hit it. There are certain numbers on a dice that might have your character inflicting extra damage, because you hit an artery. Then there are other numbers that might cause you to actually stab yourself. There's a certain amount of chance to everything we do. Maybe a critical miss is to get fired by your biggest customer for a terrible defect - and maybe a critical win is to have that new feature result in a ridiculously large number of new customers. I've seen it all. Sometimes things backfire. The best plan is to have a backout plan - and be prepared for the critical hit pushing your team forward a year or two with one deal. If you don't try, you might not get it!  There are so many direct correlations with software development as well - the way that you run a game, the rules that you set out and the NPCs (demons, anyone?) are just a few. Hopefully these tips give you fond memories of bad hair, ill-fitting clothes, and some of the best times with your friends. And maybe they help you next time you're in a standup and need to get a treasure chest open so the team can split the loot! -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

Dave Morgan, CEO and Founder of Simulmedia, said it was possible that he would identify specific advertisers participating in the pilot test at the company's PeopleFronts event today in Manhattan.  The initiative has roots in Morgan's relationship with Carolyn Everson, Facebook's VP of Global Marketing Solutions, dating to her tenure as Chief Operating Officer of ad sales at Viacom's MTVN unit. At the recent Advertising Research Foundation Rethink conference, they began talking about analyzing and matching campaign deliveries across TV and social.  ""The research is great, talking about the unduplicated reach for an advertiser when they are on TV or on Facebook,"" Morgan says. ""We're talking a true match, not just approximations or segmentations or models.""  There are several immediate benefits for brand marketers seeking to coordinate reach and frequency.  ""You may want to take advantage of the expanded combined reach of TV and Facebook or other social media and reduce redundant frequency,"" Morgan explains.

11,Kali Kasprzyk,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kali-kasprzyk/sporting-goods-industry-t_b_9644708.html,Sporting Goods Industry: Take These Digital Strategy Hints From Beauty,"When it comes to digital, one industry is making waves in how they are utilizing it. This industry may seem like an unlikely candidate for digital, as traditionally it was a very sensory experience -- smelling, examining in all lighting conditions, the occasional taste test(?!), and of course lots of sampling. Alas, those days are largely in the past. What is this industry, you ask? Beauty.  Playing by a new set of rules, it has become one of the fastest-growing segments of the United States' nearly $300 billion online retail sales market in large part due to convenient delivery, personalized experiences, competitive pricing, and access to a wealth of information online. This has created an attractive alternative -- or at least a strong complement -- to the in-store beauty buying experience. So much so, that fellow B2C industries, like sporting goods, could learn a thing or two.  Why am I picking on sporting goods? Well, the landscapes of sporting goods and beauty are actually very similar. The demand that drives purchasing for both industries largely takes demographic, consumer income, and current trends into consideration. Both industries are also highly concentrated, with a handful of companies accounting for well over half of the revenue. That means that smaller companies wishing to succeed and even big players that want even more of the pie, need to focus that much more on engaging with their target market- which is largely spending time online.  So... just what is beauty doing online and how can a sporting goods supplier hop in the game to win big?  ""How To"" Tutorials: Beauty does a great job in this space. From YouTube, to Periscope, to other social media channels, beauty brands are spreading the word on how to use their products, and consumers are loving it. Sigma Beauty partnered with Echidna to help relaunch their website, and now on almost any product it not only shows a picture of the product, but offers a video to show viewers to use it. How to do something helps people buy the product you are teaching them about, and on top of that builds search and brand engagement.  Auto Replenishment: The days of waking up to discover you are out of deodorant are over. Thanks to eCommerce platforms, 38% of beauty and health consumers are now signed up for a subscription service, according to a new report from Business Insider Intelligence. Many consumers opt to reorder favorite products by subscription to save time and money. Think outside the box sporting goods industry, you can take this way beyond deodorant and toilet paper.  Industry Influencers: Sporting goods has big deals with big name athletes, but what about someone a bit more.... accessible? Beauty does a wonderful job creating relationships with strategic industry influencers out there. Who is an industry influencer? Industry influencers give your brand an easy way to establish a personality and be relatable. For example, Lancôme worked with Michelle Phan, a make-up expert and YouTube vlogger, for a perfume promo. Before the partnership, Lancôme had about 5 million YouTube subscribers. After the partnership, it had 20 million. The brand channel has continued to build on the momentum it gained through the joint campaign.  Subscription Boxes: Beauty has literally made billions in this space, and for good reason. Shoppers love paying a small monthly fee to play around with new products they may have never purchased otherwise, and research shows that customers who subscribe to boxes buy more products overall than people who don't. Not to mention the fact that this is a great way for brands to gain insight on customers' needs and wants. The Sportsman's Box has a foot in door with this service, but the industry still has a ways to go before it becomes mainstream.  Who are some sporting goods brands that are winning the M.V.P. award when it comes to digital? What are they doing that puts them ahead of their competition? -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

12,Em & Lo,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/em-and-lo/the-future-is-now-13-remo_b_9645460.html,The Future Is NOW: 13 Remote-Controlled Sex Toys Available Today,"  Co-written and -researched with our go-to psychologist, Dr. AlanK:   You are here and your sweetheart is there...either across a crowded room or across a continent. What to do? When your partner was close, you'd have to get up, go over, reach out and touch them; when they were far away, you'd have to email, sext or Skype. But that was before technology made distance (somewhat) obsolete. With teledildonics, the science of remotely controlled sex, you can now get up close and personal no matter how near or far away you are. The question is: how good can you get it?  Within a Room Your options across a crowded room are almost too numerous and too enjoyable to count. Since this is mature technology, you can find vibrating dildos, bullets, and eggs with remote controls for same-room use from a range of vendors. But be aware that quality really varies, so if you don't recognize or trust the brand name, find out what the product is made of, who you're buying it from and what kind of reviews it gets. Here are some good bets: Lelo This Swedish manufacturer (EMandLO.com's BFF's -- see sidebar) offers an entire line of remote-controlled pleasure objects, including an internal vibrator (Tiana), beads (Hula), a bullet vibe (Lyla), a couples ring (Oden), and even something exclusively for the boys (Hugo for prostate stimulation). All are radio controlled with enough strength to work across a room. Their rechargeable (and damn-fun-to-play-with) remote controls using their trademarked SenseMotion technology reacts to hand movements and, to some extent, lets you feel what your partner feels. They're  gorgeous and made of great body-safe stuff. Just thinking of what you could do at your next party or on your next dinner date is worth what they cost: one of you waves your hand and the other squirms with delight.  OhMiBod This reliable company has well-made, nice-looking vibrators with different levels of remote control.  What made them famous was their original music-driven vibrators (they vibrate to the beat of your chosen music for a ""dual sensory experience""). They're available wired (an included splitter allows both the vibrator and your headphones to be plugged into your MP3 player) OR wireless (you plug your MP3 player into the included receiver), and come in various shapes (wands, rabbits, or g-spotters). The most control your partner has is really just choosing the playlist. Next is their ClubVibe, a wearable device that slips into its own one-size-fits-most black lace thong (your own panties will do) -- the remote can be controlled manually by you or your luvva (nearby or across the room) OR it can be set to respond to ambient noise, such as music at a club (i.e. get your freak on in more ways than one), your partner's voice, or even a lecture by the professor you have a crush on.  Hot Octopuss Their Pulse II Duo, awesomely nicknamed ""The Guybrator,"" is a male penile stimulator with external vibrations -- and a remote control -- for her. Imagine something that looks like a macho seashell, or even an elegant taco shell, into which a penis is inserted. Its interior utilizes actual oscillation (not just vibration) for his pleasure which is controlled via buttons on the device itself. The soft underside, designed for her pleasure while he wears it (and she presses up/down against it), vibrates via a remote control. It can be used with lube in a sliding motion, or without in a static position. It's a close-range-only gadget but unique in what it does (though reviews are mixed on Amazon).  PicoBong On the horizon is the new app-controlled series from happy, shiny fun-makers PicoBong called Remoji. Four new sex toys  designed for both women AND men -- a G-spotter, a male masturbation sleeve, a penis ring and a butt plug, all vibrating -- will be controlled via the Bluetooth-enabled app. These waterproof vibes will have 6 different vibration patterns based on different musical genres (jazz, punk, dubstep, indie, techno and  hiphop) and will be able to sync to ambient rhythms.  It's in Indiegogo development right now -- supporters get 40% off the toys once they hit the market. PicoBong's raised four times their fundraising target so far, so it's looking good they'll be a reality soon.  Across the Miles Unfortunately, the further away you go the harder it is to find satisfaction. For example, Highjoy, which made a remotely controlled Rabbit in 2007 that uses a VGA(!) connector, has an updated version which requires a monthly subscription, but the reviews are terrible (apparently it's quite buggy) and its manufacturer Doc Johnson is not known for high quality products. Fortunately, OhMiBod has come to the rescue! OhMiBod Their BlueMotion vibes, either wearable or wand-shaped, are Bluetooth enabled so they can be controlled via an iPhone or Android from across the room OR -- get this -- from across an ocean! You just download the free app and start tapping and turning the virtual dials in ways you think your partner will love! Reviews are mixed, but right now it's the best long distance option.  The Platonic Ideal Of course, the ultimate goal of teledildonics is a two-way device. For example, a straight man might have a Fleshlight-type sleeve at his computer and his movements in it would be sent to his computer (via wifi or Bluetooth or radio signal), through the Internet to his partner's computer, and then to a device attached to her, with his motions echoed by her device -- and vice versa. Connect via Skype, whisper sweet nothings, work your devices, and voila: transcontinental intimacy! Unfortunately this Holy Grail of techno-sex has been almost here for years:  e.g. Sinulator (RIP 2004), Elaico (2013), Lovepalz (2013), and Kiiroo (2014). A net search will reveal article after techie article, all sounding the same but all about different products, and--alas--all have been vaporware, sometimes offered for pre-market release, but never quite hitting the shelves. Given the challenges of producing just a decent one-way gadget, it's not surprising that even an enormous amount of time and money have failed to give us a perfect two-way system yet. The current attention getter is a linked pair of gadgets called Max and Nora (why not Nick and Nora from The Thin Man, or even the titular characters from 2008's indie rom com?). Offered by the start-up firm Lovense (there's a website but no dealer network), Max and Nora are real--you can buy them--but the integrated software is iffy. Still, Lovense seems to be pairing up with a virtual reality porn studio, and nothing drives technology like porn. Maybe this time, unlike the last half dozen times, it will eventually work. Fingers crossed you see this, or something like it, in your favorite feminist toy store soon -- that's the truest test of a product's legitimacy.  And if you're holding out for that three-dimensional virtual reality you've been reading about, a la Oculus Rift? Sorry: not until the day after the day after tomorrow. The bandwidth is just too great for the current Internet.  Until we get gigabit access, I'd put my money toward a plane ticket.

14,Brian Hughes,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-hughes/top-5-file-sharing-apps-f_b_9637234.html,Top 5 File Sharing Apps for 2016: Best Solutions for Small Businesses," Image source: PhotoDune  Still emailing photos between your phone and computer? Tracking down lost USB drives for file transfers? Or worse, relying on a cloud storage device for your business documents that lacks sufficient encryption security? Put an end to the file sharing madness with fast, secure instant file sharing across devices and operating systems. Mobile devices are great for sharing files, provided of course that you have the right tools.  These are five of the best file sharing apps for 2016:  Problem: Need unlimited, fast and secure file sharing  Solution: Infinit  As the name suggests, Infinit is an intuitive, one-click solution that makes it easy to send files up to 30 times faster than existing solutions. That's all thanks to Infinit's point-to-point technology and bank-level encryption algorithms for maximum file sharing security. According to Infinit, the one-click solution lets users send anything in four seconds via a desktop or mobile device. Infinit is free for up to 10 GB transfer size limit and 1 GB of storage. Invite two friends and upgrade to the ""Plus"" version that offers 50 GB size limit and 3 GB of storage. A team option with unlimited transfer sizes, a custom domain, password protected links and team branding is offered for $12/mo per user.  Problem: Need to share large files without using mobile data  Solution: SHAREit  Whether you're sharing from phone to phone, PC to phone, phone to PC or PC to tablet, SHAREit powers near-instant transfers of music, video, photos and documents between your computers, smartphones, and tablets- all without any size restrictions. The SHAREit app works up to 200 times faster than Bluetooth. For phone to phone, simply select the content you want to share, select the receiver (like a co-worker's phone or your own computer) and hit send. You'll be instantly connected to send data back and forth.  Problem: Need fast file synching without cloud security vulnerabilities  Solution: BitTorrent Sync  BitTorrent Sync provides fast, intelligent file syncing and transfers while bypassing cloud security vulnerabilities. Sync finds the fastest, shortest transfer route between two devices while skipping the cloud. This means there's no uploading to third parties, which reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities. Have a big file? Sync can handle it. Sync is able to share folders that contain gigabytes and even terabytes of data. Sync works between multiple platforms and devices, including operating systems (OS X, Windows, Linux, NAS devices) and iOS, Android and Windows mobile devices. Sync shares files without the Internet sends large files fast and empowers better teamwork solutions around shared assets.  Problem: Need file sharing without an Internet connection  Solution: SuperBeam  No Internet connection? No problem. Supercharge your file transfers across Android products. SuperBeam uses Wi-Fi direct technology (or whatever Wi-Fi connection is available) to transmit your data at high speeds. Pair devices using a QR code, NFC (near field communication) or simply entering a sharing key for devices with no camera or NFC capabilities. SuperBeam reports transfer speeds are usually between 20 to 40 Mbps, although some users with high-end devices have been able to reach transfer speeds as high as 75 Mbps. Share documents, contacts, images, music, apps and entire folders.  Problem: Need faster solution for sharing between laptop and smartphone  Solution: Pushbullet  If you frequently share photos, screenshots, and notes between your computer and smartphone, Pushbullet is for you. The app connects all your devices so they feel like one device, using a chat-like interface. For your desktop, Pushbullet offers a browser extension that lets you send links, files and text to multiple devices at once. When you're away from the computer, the mobile app lets you quickly share messages and files with friends who are using the service. Pushbullet works just like a chat app for the file sharing between your phone, your desktop and other friends using the app. One downside is that Pushbullet restricts file transfer to a single file at a time. Want to share an entire mixtape's worth of audio tracks? You'll need to upgrade to another Pushbullet app. Pushbullet works with Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Windows, Opera, Android and iOS.  Bottom line:  Stop relying on cables, USBs, email or text messages to move files, photos, music, apps and more between your computer and smartphone. With the right file sharing app, you'll be able to securely and (almost) instantly send needed business information. -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

15,Brian de Haaff,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-de-haaff/how-to-be-obnoxious-and-g_b_9636544.html,How to Be Obnoxious and Get Ahead,"  I know an attorney who many consider to be obnoxious (and it is not just because he is a lawyer.) He is quick-witted, abrasive, and eager to argue his point of view. And he is also a close-talker. But here is the thing -- most of the time, he is right.  I consider him a friend -- even when he annoys me and I need a little separation time. And guess what? He is also wildly successful.  If you have been alive for any period of time, you know people like my attorney friend. We all have our own peculiarities, and often those oddball characteristics are what make us great.  But unfortunately, many people in the workplace today have internalized the opposite message. They have been taught that they must take the ""personal"" out of work in order to succeed.  They cover up anything that might make them stand out, and muzzle any character quirks deemed undesirable or obnoxious by others. But I disagree with that thinking.  You should be allowed to release your best self at work -- even those obnoxious parts you have stuffed away and told to be quiet.  Now, do not get me wrong. I am not talking about behavior that disrespects anyone else. I think we all have an obligation to avoid harming others, and should do our best to avoid hurting ourselves as well. What I am talking about is feeling free to be the same person all the time, even in the workplace.  Yes, it takes courage and vulnerability to finally set your ego free. But do it anyway.  The more you allow your authentic self to come through, you will experience more:  Creativity You will rediscover parts of yourself that you thought were gone for good but were only forgotten. Those personality quirks are key to your creative flow. And once you stop limiting yourself and allow those fresh ideas to start bubbling up, you will achieve much more - because you are finally being true to yourself and developing your own potential. No matter who you are, achievement with integrity is what really matters.  Joy Researchers have found that our happiness depends on our internal qualities and character strengths, not outside factors. So, if you want to pursue happiness, do not squelch the very characteristics that make you who you are and bring you joy, even if they might be off-putting to your coworkers. Other people will also benefit from finally getting to know the real you -- even if they do not always agree with everything you say or do.  Confidence It takes guts to be who you really are, regardless of what anyone else thinks or says about you. Let this be a defining moment -- the day you decided to stop living by everyone else's standards and started living by your own. That act of protest will strengthen your character and shore up your confidence -- and make it easier for you to venture farther in the future.  Freedom Curating that perfect, work-appropriate facade requires a great deal of energy -- and to what end? By the end of the day, you just feel weighed down and you fail to grow. You will feel tremendous relief when you cast off that rigid role and decide to accept yourself just the way you are. When you stop caring what others think, you can follow your own path and do what you want.  Remember -- this is not about choosing yourself over others or deliberately sabotaging your relationships. It is about being more of the genuine you, and using that to your advantage and to benefit others on your team.  We live in a messy, imperfect world filled with curious, imperfect people. To try and change that or pretend otherwise is to live an inauthentic life -- and miss out on fulfilling your own potential.  Stop living to please others. Start being yourself. Life is just too short to be anyone else.  Do you agree? -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

But then your world comes crashing down around you. The clip unsurprisingly went viral on Twitter. And as it turns out, these aren't just some strange alien train tracks. Some very sharp people on the social media site identified the creepy occurrence as the Jastrow Illusion, which was discovered by psychologist Joseph Jastrow back in 1889. When identical curved objects are placed next to one another, with the longer side of an object juxtaposing the shorter side of the other identical object -- as it is in the video -- the illusion is created.  So you can chill out and take comfort in the fact that you aren't just seeing things.  -- This feed and its contents are the property of The Huffington Post, and use is subject to our terms.

17,Michael S Solomon,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-s-solomon/the-myth-of-the-tech-tale_b_9349542.html,The Myth of the Tech Talent Shortage,"  If you are looking to hire top-notch attorneys for $100/hour, you will quickly find there is a tremendous shortage of attorneys. Based on this, you might come to the conclusion that there aren't enough great attorneys but guess what, there's no shortage of top-level attorneys as long as you're willing to pay what the market has deemed them to be worth.  And why do many companies pay over $1000/hr for top attorneys? Because the work they do is too important to entrust to anyone but the best.  The same is true in most sectors but especially in Tech.  In my role as co-founder of 10x Management, I negotiate payment terms for some of the top coders in the world. We place elite technologists (developers, UX/UI, data scientists, etc.) into projects that are simply too important for our customer companies to risk on technologists who don't have the chops, drive, communication skills or vision to build world-class technology.  We have no trouble placing the world's best and brightest tech talent at top firms because these companies believe in the old adage: Buy right, buy once. In today's hyper-competitive business environment, companies don't have time to source the wrong people. Speed to market has never been more important.  For a long time, top companies like Google and Facebook gobbled up all the top talent in the Valley. Today, the greatest minds in tech seek representation from a company like ours because they want the freedom to work on multiple projects for multiple companies and work on mission critical projects. And they also want to be compensated in accordance with the value they provide.  Is $250/hr a lot for an exceptional senior coder? Not really if you consider that one person can solve harder problems faster and more elegantly than a handful of lesser coders (who may never be able to solve that same problem anyway). Not really if she is building a solution that will increase the value of the company exponentially, as was the case with one of our developers last year.  So, let's not talk anymore about the ""tech talent shortage."" Is it hard to find world-class talent? Yes. Is it impossible if you are willing to pay for it? No. The real problem is that companies are stuck in an old way of valuing labor. They believe ""non-executive tech employees"" should report to the office everyday like employees in other industries and earn somewhere in the low six figures like comparable employees in other industries. While there is an aggregate shortage of people to build technology and that is not a myth, the idea that great people can't easily be found is a fallacy that only comes into play when you add in a pricing limitation.  The rub here is that top-tech talent can provide 1,000's times more value than non-tech employees by virtue of the scalability and efficiency of the solutions they are building. And they can often do so better from the privacy of their own homes, without the near-constant distractions of cubicle/office life.  If companies were making offers to technologists that were commensurate with what they pay their attorneys, I think we would find the supposed ""tech shortage"" would rapidly disappear for those companies. It's a simple matter of supply and demand. There is no question that there are not enough of these people to go around but the companies who increase rates first will see huge rewards in the form of great talent at the ready.  Sure, lavish cafeterias and ping-pong tables will work well to attract the twenty-something engineers fresh out of school, but more senior developers who have been around long enough to realize their true value aren't wooed by all-you-can-eat buffets and free dry cleaning. They value far different perks. They value freedom, autonomy, diversity of experience and the ability to work on projects they're passionate about.  Our fledgling talent agency for technologists has a waiting list out the door of over several thousand high level engineers, data scientists, designers, cryptocurrency experts, cyber security experts, and more. I would love to say our success is due to the fact that we are brilliant and wonderful marketers, but the reality is that as soon as we built it, they came.  We came into to tech after 20 years in the entertainment industry recognizing that true value lies with the talent and not anyone else. Once they recognized our perspective on this, they lined up to join us acknowledging that we created a business model where their wins were our wins and vice versa.  But our tech consultants (10x-ers) aren't the only ones delighted with this new model. Our customers, the product managers and VPs at top-level enterprise firms and start-ups who hire on our 10x-ers are just as thrilled. Vetting, hiring and on-boarding a top-level engineer used to take months. With our deep bench of world-class talent at the ready, we have had eyes and fingers deep in the codebase of our client companies in literally days.  The talent is out there. Your development problems can be solved, and quickly. But you need to think outside the W-2 box. There is no talent shortage for companies willing to think about their tech talent the way they think about their outside legal counsel: The stakes are too important for sub-optimal talent.  Or, as they say: Buy right, buy once.  I'd like to hear your thoughts or comments. Do you agree or disagree?

18,Andy Plesser,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andy-plesser/video-most-advertising-is_b_9644716.html,Most Advertising Is Irrelevant: Quantcast's Feldman Wants More (VIDEO),"Twenty-two years after the first web banner ad, you may have thought the online advertising business was pretty mature by now. But fear over a worsening consumer advertising sentiment, plus excitement about a new wave of ad outcomes, may mean the industry is only just beginning. ""Most advertising today isn't relevant,"" according to Quantcast CEO Konrad Feldman, whose company measures web audiences. ""It doesn't have to be that way."" Feldman sees a parallel with another online business that, once, was nascent but which has certainly now grown up. ""Think about our experience with search,"" he tells Beet.TV. ""Whenever we conduct a search, most of the results that come back are relevant and useful to us. That demonstrates the power of data and technology. Web search is only 20 years old. The same opportunity exists for all other forms of media."" Looking beyond what digital ads look, feel and perform like today is only natural. Despite growing to represent the largest-grossing ad medium in many countries now, online ads are suffering from audience aversion and often plummeting effectiveness. It's no wonder a smorgasbord of ad-tech vendors is claiming to bring a whole new, more upbeat paradigm shift to a gloomy sector. For Feldman, that will come not from rerouting existing ad practices through programmatic channels but in the ability to crunch data en masse, better targeting to achieve better relevance. ""The much larger opportunity is how we make advertising relevant for consumers and drive better outcomes by using data and technology modify content in real-time,"" he says. ""It's still quite early.""    This video was recorded at the 4A's Transformation conference in Miami.   For additional interviews, please visit this page.

19,Ryan Grenoble,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2016/04/08/facebook-branded-content-publish-marketers_n_9644546.html,Facebook Will Delete Stealth ‘Branded Content’ In Your Feed," If it looks like an ad, and it reads like an ad, Facebook wants publishers to make sure readers know when it is, in fact, an ad. The social network giant announced its new branded content policy on Friday, and it will delete posts that don't follow the new rules. “Just like all content on Facebook, branded content will go through a review process,"" the company said in a statement. ""We will begin ramping up enforcement over the next few weeks to remove non-compliant branded content or disapprove ads for lack of compliance.” The policy applies to verified pages (ones with a blue checkmark), which can now begin pushing branded content to their followers on the social network -- so long as publishers tag the brands they're promoting in the post itself. Theoretically, that means if a company like Hershey paid a pop star to post a video of them frolicking in a field full of chocolate bars, that celebrity would have to tag the company in the placement. Here's what an example that Facebook provided of branded content (featuring a video of Lady Gaga that Intel paid for) looks like:  In addition to flagging the content to readers as an ad paid for by a sponsor, marketers will now have access to metrics indicating how well pieces of branded content perform. Marketers will have the option of sharing the post on their own page pay Facebook to ""boost"" their reach. ""This update is something that media companies, public figures, influencers, and marketers have been asking for, as branded content is a growing and evolving part of the media landscape,"" wrote Facebook product manager Clare Ruben and vice president of partnerships Nick Grudin in a blog post announcing the changes.
